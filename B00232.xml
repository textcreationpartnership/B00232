            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He cauſe why the Ancients by fire ſignifie Loue, is, for that this Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is the hardeſt to be hid: For the more a man ſeekes to couer it, the more it diſcouers it ſelfe, and blabbs the place, where it is. Of this quality is Loue, and truly participateth of the nature of fire. I came (ſaith our Sauiour Chriſt) to put fire into the world. And the holy Ghoſt, which is the true God of Loue, came and ſhewed it ſelfe in the ſhape and figure of fire. So that Loue is a kinde of extraordinary actiue fire. Nor can it, whereſoeuer it be, be hid, or idle. <hi>Ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratur magna, ſi eſt,</hi> (ſaith Saint <hi>Gregory) ſi autem non operatur, amor non eſt.</hi> Loue will be alwayes in action, alwayes in working; it worketh by benefits; it
<pb facs="tcp:180809:6"/>
worketh by good workes, and by friendly offices, and charitable ſeruices: And when it cannot worke what it would, or when the ſubiect whereon it would worke, hath no need thereof, it ſupplyeth that defect with good deſires, and words. God, who needeth not the ſeruice of any, contents himſelfe with this in thoſe that are his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants, accepting (when they can no more) the will, for the deed. And the Kings, which here vpon earth repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent his perſon, doe not require tribute and ſeruice, ſaue onely in that, which euery one is able to giue. That which J am able to affoord, and doe here offer vnto your Maieſtie, forced thereunto by the loue of my ſeruice, (howbeit my deſire hath euermore had a larger extent) is onely a parcell of words; which if they proceed from the ſoule, and come truly and ſincerely from the heart, are of ſome worth and eſtimation, and perhaps (vpon occaſion) may proue likewiſe profitable and aduantagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous. Howſoeuer, it may ſerue at least to expreſſe that my ſeruice and deuotion, which euer hath beene, is, and ſhall be ready preſt to ſerue your Maieſtie. And I am willing to ſhew it in this little, that <hi>I</hi> may not wholly ſeeme vnprofitable. And therefore with this affection of Loue, ſutable to my ſubiect, ouercomming thoſe feares which are wont (and not without reaſon) to withhold thoſe that treate with great Kings, Princes, and Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narckes, and write of ſuch and the like ſubiects, I pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume to aduertiſe them, and in this paper to propone
<pb facs="tcp:180809:6"/>
vnto them, that which I finde written of thoſe that are paſt and gone, (and ſeemeth very fit and conuenient for the conſeruation and augmentation of the authority and greatneſſe of thoſe that are now liuing and preſent a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt vs) and will with all poſsible breuity, procure a full reſolution and diſtinction herein: And (as <hi>Seneca</hi> ſaith) <hi>Totum comprehendere ſub exiguo;</hi>

not be diſeſteemed as an egge of mine owne hatching) with the examples of Kings and Emperours, (if the exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of Kings may moue Kings) and with thoſe which cannot but moue, bee eſteemed, and beleeued, being drawne out of the holy Scripture. Which being well ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerued and put in execution by Kings, they ſhall obtaine that end for which they were intended; To wit, to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine and preſerue their Kingdomes in peace and iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice.</p>
            <p>Reade it therefore, <hi>I</hi> beſeech your Maieſtie, and take it to heart; for it is a piece of worke that is directed to the ſeruice of Kings, of their Fauourites and Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters. And let them not ſay, that they are Metaphyſicall, and impracticable things, or, in a manner, meere im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſsibilities, but rather, that they are very conforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to our poſsibilitie, and practiſed by our Predeceſſors, Princes of famous memory, for their wiſedome and pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, and in Kingdomes and Common-wealths, of great Concernment, Artifice, and Policie, in matter of Gouernement, and reaſon of State. And viewing thoſe with theſe times, and that which then was, with that which now is, it will appeare vnto vs, that your pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Princes doe not come much behinde their good Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deceſſours: And that which is good, ſtands alwayes in a way or degree of ableneſſe to become better: and that which is not ſo, may be bettered in the end. Time is a great proficient, it attaineth to all, and can doe all. And
<pb facs="tcp:180809:7"/>
your Maieſtie (whom God preſerue) may likewiſe in time doe the like, if you will really and reſolutely affect the ſame; and that you will be pleaſed to put in execution, what in theſe Aduertiſements ſhall ſeeme good in your eyes. And ſeeme they, or not ſeeme they good vnto you, ſure I am, that my deſire, in theſe, in the reſt, and in all, ſhall indeuour to hit the marke whereat it aymeth. God direct it as I deſire. For mine owne part, J reſt well con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented with my paines, and hold my ſelfe well paid for my labour, in hauing put them into your Maieſties hands. And that you ſhall vouchſafe to dwell a little vpon them. For matters of State, Juſtice, and Gouernment, and of things of this high nature, is a King-craft, and a know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge or ſcience that deſerues your care and diſcourſe. Let others doe as they lift; particular men may follow their particular pleaſures and delights. But this well be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commeth Kings.</p>
            <p>The Argument of this Booke, is the Head of Mans body; beginning at the vnderſtanding, till we come to the laſt of the ſenſes. For therein, and thence they haue the <hi>principium</hi> or beginning of their operations. And as in mans body, ſo in the myſticall body of a Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth, Kings are the Head, to whom Regiment &amp; Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernment belongs; and what choyce they are to make of thoſe who are to aſsiſt them therein; the qualities which they ought to haue, and how they ſhould carry them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues towards them. How they ſhall come to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couer

               <hi>I</hi> ſearch not into the ſecret cloſet of any mans boſome, nor touch vpon any particular perſon, it being the leaſt part of my intent and purpoſe. I treate onely in the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall, and manifeſt vnto all, that what I write, being cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine and true, and grounded vpon principles and cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine cauſes, may ſerue to reforme, amend, and correct, and (if neede bee) alter thoſe faſhions and cuſtomes they finde to bee amiſſe. This I am bold to vtter vnto your Maieſtie, and dedicate the ſame with that ſecuritie and confidence, which mine owne knowledge doth pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe and prompt vnto mee; being not ignorant, that I talke and diſcourſe with mine owne proper King and Lord, whom I humbly beſeech, that hee will bee pleaſed, out of his great prudence and naturall pietie, to runne all this ouer with his eye, and to caſt his cloake ouer my faults. And though (no doubt) his Maieſtie may meete with ſome, yet my minde telleth me, that he may likewiſe light vpon ſomething in this Treatiſe, that may be of ſome profit for the ſeruice of his Maieſtie, and for the conſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation of that authoritie and greatneſſe of place (which he ſo iustly poſſeſſeth, and for the good of the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth. For, there is not that Booke ſaith <hi>Seneca</hi>) ſo vnprofitable, whence ſome good may not bee gathered. And though this (in ſuppoſall, or it's owne nature) may
<pb facs="tcp:180809:8"/>
be ſmall, and of little or no price, yet is it of no leſſe no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and royall a condition, to receiue a little louingly, and with a gratious acceptance, then to giue much liberally. All this your Maiestie doth with all, and I aſſure my ſelfe you will likewiſe doe the like with me. For the naturall Loue which I beare vnto your Maieſtie, meriteth no leſſe, nor the minde wherewithall J doe it. And herewith I ſhall in ſome ſort ſatisfie my deſire (which is to hit the marke I ayme at) and that obligation, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with I was borne to ſerue you, whom I ſhall neuer wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly offend. And euermore, in all my prayers, and ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices, I ſhall humbly on my knees beſeech the Almighty God, to preſerue your Maieſtie, to giue you many, and thoſe moſt happie yeares, and that hee will conſerue you in his diuine grace, and humane Greatneſſe, with much augmentation of Eſtate, both Temporall and Eternall. Amen.</p>

                  </note> To wit: from the definition, or Deſcription. I ſay with <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> and <hi>Plato,</hi> That a Common-wealth is no other thing, ſaue an Order of Citizens, and Cities; in which and amongſt whom, nothing is wanting, that is neceſſary and needefull for the life of Man. It is a iuſt gouernment, and diſpoſition of many families, and of a Communitie amongſt them, with a ſuperiour authoritie ouer them. And it is a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation of many people vnited together, fraternized, with certaine Lawes and rules of gouernment. And, becauſe I will not looſe time in things not neceſſarie, I omit that gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which the <hi>Greekes</hi> call <hi>Ariſtocratia,</hi> which is the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernment of the Nobility, as it is with the Signorie of <hi>Venice.</hi> And your <hi>Democratia,</hi> which is popular, and conſiſtes of the Many, as that of <hi>Genoa,</hi> and the Cantons of the <hi>Switz.</hi> Which (though approued by many) haue their inconueni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences, and thoſe no ſmall ones. For the Nobilitie, and power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full perſons, if they not perſeuere in the obſeruance of the Lawes of good gouernment, they preſently grow to be couetous, and are much ſubiect to Ambition. And becauſe they are but a few, they feare the multitude; and for to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue themſelues, exerciſe cruelty; whereby in the ende it turnes to a Tyrannie. For (as <hi>Mecoenas</hi> ſaith.) The ſtate of a few Lords, is the ſtate of a few Tyrants. And he that is the moſt powerfull, the moſt ambitious, and beſt be friended, and reſpected of the people, vpon the leaſt diſſenſion, ioynes with the multitude, which being it is naturally enuious, mutable and a friend to innouation, will with a great deale of facilitie ouerthrow the Common-wealth. And ſay, the Nobles do not
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:180809:12"/>
ſide, but agree amongſt themſelues, yet cannot they but liue in feare of the infidelitie of the Vulgar; for ordinarily, thoſe that haue a hand in the gouernment, are more enuied, then thoſe that haue none at al. Beſides, it is a weake kind of gouernment, nor is it poſſible, that theſe few Lords, can in large, conquer, &amp; conſerue a great Empire, as can a King, or a Monarke, becauſe the forces are leſſe vnited in them, then in him. And the people which is little intereſſed, &amp; hath no ſhare or part in thoſe ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable places, carry a Capital hatred to your great perſons, and are hardly drawn to ſuch liberall Contributions, as may ſuſtaine a War, and ſubdue kingdomes. Your popular Eſtate in falling from that equality, which it pretendeth, is eaſily con<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>uerted into a licentious libertie, or rather looſeneſſe, pulling down ſome, &amp; ſetting vp others, and is much ſubiect to Alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations through it's inconſtancie, &amp; weake head-pieces of the Popular. For (as <hi>Tully</hi> ſaith) the ſea hath not ſo many ſtormes, perills, &amp; tempeſtes, as hath this kind of Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>monwealth. And of force (euery one attending his owne proper good and priuate intereſt) it muſt runne vpon one of theſe two rockes: Either on the Tyrannie of him, that is the ſtrongeſt, and, vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held by the fauour of the Maior part, liftes vp himſelfe aboue them all: Or on the <hi>Plebeian</hi> gouernment, then which none can be worſe; for all then falls into the hands of ignorant peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple who put ordinary people into the higheſt places of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and command, without any diſtinction or reckoning of rich, noble, wiſe, or vertuous. What good Counſaile, or ſound Aduiſe can all the Communaltie giue (put all their braines together) in a doubtfull caſe, or buſineſſe of importance,<note place="margin">Eccl. 7.27.</note> when (as <hi>Salomon</hi> ſaith) there is ſcarce one to be found of a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand, of abilitie and ſufficiencie in this kinde? But put caſe that ſuch a one may happily be found amongſt them, how ſhall he be heard with ſilence. What patience will their eares lend him? What ſecrecie will be had in that which is treated, be it of Peace, or War, that it be not divulged before it's due execution? your Tumultes and ſeditions, ſhall be more or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:180809:13"/>
and greater then in other ſtates; becauſe your meaner ſorte of people, are gouerned more by their owne vnruly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petites, and womaniſh longings, then by reaſon and diſcre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. And your baſe and cruell Vulgar, which vpon the leaſt occaſion ſuffers it ſelfe to be led away by hatred, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenge, preſently falls to taking of ſtones in their hands, tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring vp the pibbles in the ſtreetes, as <hi>Cicero</hi> ſets downe vnto vs, that in the popular aſſemblies of Rome, it ſo fell out, that oftentimes they drew their naked ſwordes, &amp; that the ſtones were ſeene to flye about their eares on all ſides. And when this head-ſtrong multitude hath once broken the reines, there is no keeping of them in, nor can the wit of man deuiſe how to bridle them. In a <hi>Monarchy,</hi> the Monarke; In an <hi>Ariſtocratia,</hi> your Noble-men are ſupreme Iudges, and Arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trators, and by this their ſupreme and abſolute power, they many times compoſe the differences of the ſubiects. But in a <hi>Democratia</hi> and Popular Eſtate, they are the ſupreme power, and they themſelues bandy one againſt another, the fire of fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, ſetting them in a conſuming flame, without acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging any ſuperiour, to decide the quarrell, and compoſe their differences. And therefore <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> ſayd; That there was not any Tyrannie either greater or more pernicious, then that of an intire Communaltie, which, of it ſelfe, is incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to crueltie. The <hi>Monarchy,</hi> or Kingdome is freer from theſe burning feuers, and by all is ranked in the beſt place, and is ſtiffely maintained by the graueſt Authors. Of this onely ſhall I treate at this preſent. It is called a <hi>Monarchy,</hi> of <gap reason="foreign">

For all naturall, and good gouernment proceedeth from One, and that which comes neereſt vnto Vnitie, hath moſt ſimilitude, with that which is diuine, and is by much the moſt perfect. By God, Kings reigne, according to that of the wiſe man. <hi>Per me, reges regnant; Per me, Principes imperant.

And if the Members of the body, being many, and bearing different Offices therein, admit to be gouerned by a Head, and that God and Nature, hath ſo ordained it, <hi>Why ſhould not a Monarchicall gouernment be the beſt? Moſt certaine therefore is it, that it is mainely to be preferred before the other two. Some will haue this Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chicall</hi> gouerment to be the moſt ancient, and that it had it's beginning from <hi>Cain, Adams</hi> eldeſt ſonne, who was the firſt, that did gather people together, built Cities, and did ſhut them vp, and fortifie them with walls.

<pb n="6" facs="tcp:180809:14"/>
Communitie, and to be obedient to one only King, poſſeſſing himſelfe of the Kingdome and Signorie of the World. And before theſe, euen in the very beginning of the Creation, God began to eſtabliſh this gouernment, &amp; forme of a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth.<note place="margin">Act, 17.26.</note> For (as S. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith) God would, that all Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kinde ſhould deſcend from one Man. And Gods choſen peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple did euermore maintaine a Monarchie, and did ordaine, that the Supreme power ſhould reſide and remaine in One. The firſt gouernours of the world, were Monarkes, &amp; did gouerne with this Title, &amp; all the Common-wealthes of the World, haue generally deſired to be gouerned by one king. As ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth by thoſe of the Gentiles, euery particular ſtate hauing his peculiar King. And were it not a great monſtrouſneſſe in nature, that one body, ſhould haue two Heads? Much more were it, that one kingdome ſhould be gouerned by two per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons: Vnitie is the Author of much good; and Pluralitie, the cauſer of much ill. The <hi>Roman</hi> Commonwealth did ſuffer much miſerie and calamitie, not becauſe all would not obey One, but becauſe many would command All. And therforein their greater neceſſities, they did create a <hi>Dictator,</hi> ſo called becauſe all did obay whatſoeuer he dictated, and ſayd vnto them. For they knew well enough, and did clearely and plainely perceiue, That in the Empire of One, the authoritie was the greater; greater the obedience, freer their determina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, firmer their Councells, ſpeedier their reſolutions, and more prompt the execution of their deſignes. In a word, Command, Signorie, and Supreme power, does better in one head then in many. And therefore all doe vnanimouſly and vndoubtedly conclude, That the Monarchie, is the ancientſt, and the durableſt of all other; and it's gouernment the beſt: yet, would I haue it to helpe it ſelfe with the <hi>Ariſtocratia</hi> in that which may be vſefull for it's aduantage. That in regard of it's ſtrength, and execution, doth by it's greater. Vnion, and force excell the reſt: This other which is compoſed of a few noble, wiſe, and vertuous perſons, becauſe it conſiſtes of
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:180809:14"/>
more, hath the more intireneſſe, prudence, and wiſedome; and by conioyning and intermixing the one with the other, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulteth a perfect &amp; abſolute gouernment. So that a <hi>Monarchy,</hi> that it may not degenerate, muſt not goe looſe, and abſolute (for Command, is a madd-man; and power <hi>Lunaticke</hi>) but muſt be tyed to the <hi>Lawes,</hi> as far forth as it is comprehended vnder the Law; And in things particular and temporall, muſt haue reference to the body of the Councell, ſeruing as the brace, or ioyning peece of timber, betweene a Monarchie, &amp; an Ariſtocracie, which is the aſſiſtance and aduiſe of the chiefer, and wiſer ſort. For, from a Monarchy not thus well and orderly tempred, ariſe great errours in gouernment, little ſatisfaction to the State, and many diſtaſtes amongſt thoſe that are gouerned. All men, that haue had the eſtimation of ſound iudgements, and accounted wiſe in all kind of faculties haue held this to be the beſt and perfecteſt gouernment, and with out it, neuer Citie nor kingdome hath beene taken to be well gouerned. Your good Kings and great Gouernours haue euer fauoured this Courſe; whereas on the contrarie, your bad kings, and euill Gouernours, tranſported with their pride, haue runne another way. And therefore, in conformitie heereunto, I dare confidently affirme, if a Monarke, (be hee what he will be) ſhall reſolue buſineſſes alone on his own head (how wiſe ſoeuer he thinke himſelf) without hauing recourſe to his Councell, or againſt the opinion of his Counſellours, (although he do <hi>Acertar</hi> and hit right in his reſolutions) yet therein, he breakes the bounds of a Monarchie, and enters in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to thoſe of a Tyranny. Of whoſe Examples, and the euill ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſes inſuing thereupon, the Hiſtories are full. But one ſhall ſerue inſtead of many. And that ſhall be of <hi>Tarquinius Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perbus,</hi> taken out of the firſt Booke of <hi>Titus Liuius,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Liv. lib. <hi>1.</hi>
                  </note> who out of his great pride, and haughtineſſe of minde, that he might rule all himſelfe, and haue none elſe to haue a hand in any buſineſſe, made it his Maſter peece, to weaken the authority of the <hi>Roman</hi> Senate in leſſening the number of Senatours.
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:180809:15"/>
Which he purpoſely did, that he wholy and ſolely by him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, might determine all whatſoeuer that occurred in the kingdome. In this Monarchie, or Kingdome, there are three parts, or parties to be conſidered, of whom principally we are to treate. The King, The Miniſters, and the Vaſſalls. And if in a humane body, the Anatomie &amp; conſideration of the Head, be the niceſt, ſubtilleſt, and moſt difficult, what dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficultie will it not be, and what a daintie hand will it not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire to touch, talke, and treate of a king, who is the head of the Commonwealth? And hence I inferre, that for to treate of Kings, and to preſcribe them Precepts and Documents touching a Kingdome, he ought to be ſuch a wiſe King, as was <hi>Salomon.</hi> Who, conſidering the difficulties and dangers, which may in this matter offer themſelues, aduiſeth all with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any difference, that they ſhould not ſeeme to be deſirous to ſeeme wiſe before their Temporall kings. For no man, howſoeuer fulfill'd with wiſedome, is (ſpeaking in his kings preſence) ſecure and ſafe. <hi>Penes Regem, noli velle videri ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piens.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Eccl. 7.5.</note> Boaſt not thy wiſedome in the preſence of the King. The reaſon is for that he that is the ſupreme ſoueraigne in Temporall power, whom all acknowledge and obey as their Superiour, riſenteth it much, to ſee himſelfe inferiour in a thing of ſo greate eſteeme, as is wiſedome and diſcretion. <hi>Xenophon,</hi> laying his foundation on this opinion, introduceth <hi>Cambiſes,</hi> inſtructing his ſonne <hi>Cyrus,</hi> King of <hi>Perſia,</hi> how he ought to carry himſelf in his Kingdome. As alſo <hi>Alexander,</hi> who receiued his Militarie Precepts from his father <hi>Philip</hi> and not from any other that was inferiour vnto him. It is written of <hi>Agaſicles,</hi> king of the <hi>Lacedemonians,</hi> that he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed to learne Philoſophie of a famous Philoſopher of thoſe times; it ſeeming vnto him, that being a king, it was not fitting, he ſhould be his Scholler, whoſe ſonne he was not. As if he ſhould haue ſayd; That he, onely by a naturall obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation, acknowledged him alone, and that he contented himſelfe with that which he had learned from him, and
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:180809:15"/>
would not acknowledge any other inferiour vnto him in birth, though neuer ſo much before him in learning and knowledge. But this difficulty I purpoſe to ouercome by propoſing, in this my Treatiſe, vnto kings, not mine owne Reaſons, nor thoſe, which I might draw from great Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers, and humane Hiſtories, but from the words of God, and of his Saints, and from Hiſtories Diuine and Canoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call, whoſe Inſtructions kings may not diſdaine, nor take it as an affront to ſubmit themſelues thereunto, be they (being Chriſtians) neuer ſo powerfull, neuer ſo ſupreme; becauſe the Author that dictates theſe Leſſons vnto them, is the Holy-Ghoſt. And if I ſhall at any time alleage the Examples of heathen Kings, and ſhall make ſome good benefit of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquitie, and ſerue my ſelfe with the ſentences of Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers, that were ſtrangers vnto Gods people, it ſhall be very ſparingly, and as it comes in my way, and as one that ceazeth vpon his owne goods (if he fortune to light vpon them) and taketh them from thoſe that vniuſtly detaine and poſſeſſe them.</p>

               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>His name of King, in Diuine and humane Letters is very ancient, and ſo old as is the firſt Man. For in Gods creating of him (euen before that there were many Men) he made him King ouer all the beaſtes of the field. And it is a moſt noble Appellatiue, and that which is better, and more neerely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſenteth vnto vs the Maieſtie of God, who very frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the holy Scriptures, and with much propriety, is called King. And it is the common opinion of the Wiſeſt, that it ſignifieth one that rules, and gouernes, being deduced from the Latine word <hi>Regere,</hi> which is to rule, or gouerne. <hi>Reges à regendo dicti ſunt,</hi> (ſaith S. <hi>Iſidore) Ideò quilibet rectè faci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>endo, regis nomen tenet, ſed peccando, amittit.</hi> And conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring with more attention, this it's true Etymologie, he is properly ſayd to be a King, who ouer maſtring his paſſions, doth firſt rule and gouerne himſelfe, cumplying (as he ought) with the obligations of his Eſtate, without offence either to God or his neighbour; and next hath a care to rule others, and, to procure all he can, that all may doe the like; And he, that ſhall do the contrary laying his foundation on hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane wiſedom, and reaſon of State, regardeth more his own temporall commoditie and proper Intereſt, then the good of the Commonwealth. This ſuteth not with the name he holdeth; nor may he be called a king, neither is he ſo for himſelfe, nor for others, becauſe he neither knowes to rule himſelfe nor others. <hi>Malus, ſi regnet</hi> (ſaith S. <hi>Auſten) ſervus eſt.</hi>

<pb n="11" facs="tcp:180809:16"/>
but in very truth, ſee how many vices reigne in him, ſo many times is hee a ſervant, nay a very ſlaue. It was the aduice of <hi>Agapitus</hi> to <hi>Iuſtinian</hi> the Emperour, that he ſhould haue an eye ouer himſelfe, and looke well to his actions; for albeit he were a King and a great Prince, yet the Title of King did then <hi>convene</hi> to him, when he ſhould be Maſter of himſelfe, and curbing his unruly appetites, ſhould of a King become a Vaſſall to Reaſon and Iuſtice. Hee that is good, and iuſt, is a God vpon earth, and from thence is the name of King deriued vnto him, and is his Vicar in all cauſes, for to maintaine his Subiects in Iuſtice and Truth by his Empire and Command, and to ſuſtaine all things in Order, Policie, and Peace. And therefore a Law of the <hi>Partida</hi> ſayes thus,<note place="margin">Lib. <hi>2.</hi> &amp; lib. <hi>7.</hi> Tit. <hi>1.</hi> part. <hi>2.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>Que el Rey es Vicario de dios, para hazer iuſticia en to dos los coſas.</hi> That a King is Gods Vicar, for to doe iuſtice in all Cauſes. Anſwering to that his owne ſaying; <hi>By me Kings reigne, &amp;c.</hi> Which is, as if he ſhould haue ſaid; That their power is deriued from God, as from the firſt and primary cauſe. The ſignification likewiſe of this word King, or <hi>Rex,</hi> is (and me thinks) farre better declared, if we ſhall but refer i'ts originall to another word of the primitiue Language, where the Hebrew word <hi>Raga</hi> ſignifies (amongſt other it's ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fications) <hi>To feede.</hi> And in this ſenſe it is to be found in many places of holy Scripture. And from this <hi>Raga,</hi> is deriued <hi>Rex, Rego,</hi> or <hi>Regno.</hi> And <hi>Regere,</hi> and <hi>Paſcere,</hi> amongſt the Poets, and euen alſo amongſt the Prophets, are promiſcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly vſed. <hi>Homer, Virgil,</hi> and <hi>Dauid,</hi> put no difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt <hi>Reges</hi> and <hi>Paſtores,</hi> ſtyling Kings Shepheards; &amp; Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heards Kings. And therefore in the 23. <hi>Pſalme,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Pſal. 23.</note> where the vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar Latine reades, <hi>Dominus regit me;</hi> S. <hi>Ieromes</hi> Tranſlation hath it, <hi>Dominus paſcit me. The Lord is my Shepheard, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore can I lack nothing, he ſhall feede me in a greene paſture, and leade me forth beſides the waters of comfort.</hi> And <hi>Homer</hi> he ſtyles a King <hi>Paſtorem populi,</hi> the Shepheard of his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; in regard of that ſweetneſſe of Command wherewith he
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:180809:17"/>
gouerneth them, and the gentle hand that hee carries ouer them, feeding, but not fleecing of them. <hi>Xenophon</hi> ſaith, that the actions of a good ſhepheard, are like vnto thoſe of a good King. So that the name of King, doth not onely ſignifie him that ruleth, but him that ruleth like a ſhepheard. And the better to inſtruct vs herein, the Prophet <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> ſpeaking of that, which the true Chriſtian King our Sauiour ſhould doe, when he ſhould come into the world, ſaith; <hi>Sicut Paſtor, gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gem ſuum paſcet,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Iſai. 40.11.</note> 
                  <hi>in brachio ſuo congregabit agnos, &amp; in ſinu ſuo levabit, foetas ipſa portabit.</hi> Hee ſhall feede his flocke like a ſhepheard, hee ſhall gather the Lambes with his armes, and carry them in his boſome, and ſhall guide them with young. He ſhall perfectly performe all the Offices of a ſhepheard by feeding of his ſheepe, and by bearing them (if neede be) vpon his ſhoulders. And of the ſelfe ſame King,<note place="margin">Ezech. 34.23.</note> Chriſt, God ſaid in reſpect of his people; <hi>Ipſe paſcet eos, &amp; ipſe erit eis in paſtorem.</hi> I will ſet vp a ſhepheard ouer them, and he ſhall feed them. And in the next words follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing he cals him ioyntly King and ſhepheard. <hi>Servus meus David Rex ſuper eos, &amp; Paſtor unus erit omnium eorum.</hi> My ſeruant <hi>Dauid</hi> ſhall bee the Prince amongſt them, and they ſhall all haue but one ſhepheard. And they ſhall dwell ſafely in the wilderneſſe, and ſleepe in the woods, and none ſhall make them affraid. And for the clearer ſignificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on hereof, the firſt Kings that God made choiſe of, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to be anoynted, hee tooke them from amidſt their flocks. The one they ſought after, the other they found fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of his flocke. The Prophet <hi>Samuel</hi> whom God com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to annoynt for King one of the ſons of <hi>Iſhai,</hi> hauing ſeene the elder and the other ſeuen (all goodly handſome men &amp; of a good diſpoſition) had no great liking to any one of them, but asked their father; Whether he had no more children but thoſe; And he ſaid vnto him; <hi>Adhuc reliquus eſt parvulus,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 Kings 16 11.</note> 
                  <hi>&amp; paſcit oves.</hi> There remaineth yet a little one behind, that keepeth the ſheepe. And the Prophet
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:180809:17"/>
willed him, that he ſhould ſend for him; for we will not ſit downe, till he become hither; ſhewing, that to be a ſhepheard and to feed the flock, was the beſt Symbole, and moſt proper Embleme of a King. And therfore I would haue no man to imagine that which <hi>Philon</hi> did feare, that when we come to make a King, we muſt take away the Crooke, and put the Scepter in his hand. The Office of a King I tell you, and the Arte of ruling, will require a great deale of ſtudy, and experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. For to gouerne the bigger ſort of beaſtes, and thoſe that are of greateſt price, a man muſt firſt haue learned to haue gouerned the leſſer. It is not meete, to Popp into great places vnexperienced perſons, and ſuch as know not what belongs vnto buſineſſe, nor the weight of the charge that they are to take vpon them. For indeede, great Matters are not handſomely carryed, nor well managed, but by ſuch as haue beene formerly imployed in buſineſſes of an inferi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our and lower nature. And this choyſe, which God made of <hi>Dauid,</hi> iumpes with this our intent. He doth not ſay,<note place="margin">De poſt fottanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus accepit eum, paſcere Iacob Servum ſuum &amp; Iſrael haere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditatem ſuam.</note> that he tooke him on the ſodaine from the ſheepefold, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently clapp't a Crowne vpon his Head; but firſt bred him vp to feede the houſe of <hi>Iacob,</hi> and his family, and that he ſhould exerciſe himſelfe therein. For a well ordered houſe, and a family that is well gouerned, is the Modell and Image of a Common-wealth; And domeſticall authoritie, reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleth Regall power. And the good guidance of a particular houſe, is the Exemplary and true patterne of a publicke State. It imbraceth and comprehendeth in it all the ſorts of good gouernment. It doth treate and ſet in order thoſe things, that appertaine to Policie, Conſeruation, and the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of Men, as well in regard of Commanding, as obey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. What other thing is a houſe with his family, but a little Citie. And <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>hat a Citie, but a great Houſe? Many houſes, make a Citie; And many Cities, make a kingdome. And in point of gouernment, they onely differ in greatneſſe, for howbeit in the one, they are buſied more, and in the other
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:180809:18"/>
leſſe, yet they tend all to one end, which is the common good. And therefore S. <hi>Paul</hi> and other Saints, and wiſe men are of opinion, that hee that knowes not how to gouerne his own houſe well, will hardly gouerne another mans. The Emperour <hi>Alexander Severus,</hi> viſiting the <hi>Roman</hi> Senate, did inquire, how the Senators did rule and gouerne their owne priuate Houſes, and families, and ſayd; That that man, who knew not how to command his wife, and his Children, to follow his owne buſineſſes, to make prouiſion for his houſe, and to gouerne his familie, it were a mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe to recommend vnto that man the gouernment of the Common-wealth. Amongſt thoſe the famous Gouernours, <hi>Cato</hi> the <hi>Roman,</hi> was preferred before <hi>Ariſtides,</hi> the <hi>Grecian,</hi> becauſe the former was a great <hi>Pater familias,</hi> or father of a familie, and the latter was noted to be defectiue in that kinde. So that the life of a ſhepheard is the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeit or Picture of gouernment, as is to be ſeene by his aſſiſtance in his Office, in the care of the wellfare of his flocke, in the obligation of the Account that he is to make, in the offence that he is to finde by Wolues and Theeues, and in the ſolicitude and watchfullneſſe, which thoſe ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary dangers doe require, wherein his flocke ſtands, and more eſpecially when the ſhepheard is wanting vnto them. And it is ſo proper vnto a King to feede his flocke, that when our Sauiour Chriſt fed that multitude of people, which followed him in the deſert,<note place="margin">Iohn 6.15.</note> they no ſooner ſaw that he had ſatisfied them, but they were deſirous to make him a King,<note place="margin">Eſay. 3.</note> and to clap the Crowne on his head. And for this cauſe in the 3. Chapter of <hi>Eſay,</hi> he that ſaw he was vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prouided of bread, would not accept the Votes of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, that were willing to nominate him for their King, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thus vnto them: <hi>Non ſum medicus, &amp; in domo mea non eſt panis, neque veſtimentum; nolite conſtituere me principem populi.</hi> There is no bread in my houſe, nor cloathing, I cannot be an helper vnto yee, therefore make
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:180809:18"/>
me no Prince of the people. And therefore with very good reaſon, and with a great deale of proprietie, a King and a Shepheard, is all one.</p>
               <p>In the Greeke tongue a King is called <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> 
                  <hi>Quaſi baſis &amp; fundamentum populi.</hi> As if hee were the baſis and foundation of the people. And of your Kings (ſayth <hi>Rabbi Abraham</hi>) thoſe words are to bee vnderſtood of <hi>Iob, Qui portant orbem;</hi> Who ſuſtaine the weight of a king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, and beare the loade thereof vpon their ſhoulders. And a Hierogliffe heereof is the Crowne which they weare vpon their head in manner of a Citie, circled about with Towres, and battlements; ſignifying thereby, that the ſtrong brayne, and the good and wiſe head,<note place="margin">Greg in Iob.</note> 
                  <hi>and ſound ſconce</hi> of a King, doth fortifie and vphold the whole weight and burthen of all the Cities of his kingdome. And this is S. <hi>Gregories</hi> Interpretation vpon this place. Some others conceiue that this name was giuen it, in conſideration of that creature called the <hi>Baſiliske;</hi> who is the king of the venomous creatures, and hath this euil qualitie with him, that he kills with his lookes onely. And doe not the kings ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times kill their fauourites, and thoſe that are neereſt about them, with the knit of the brow and a ſower looke? And ſome ſuch Kings there be (or at leaſt haue beene) in the world, that take it offenſiuely, if their frownes and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fauours, doe not kill like poyſon. But this Etymologie hath little ground for it. For the Greeke word <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> which in that language ſignifies a king, is much different from that of <hi>Baſiliſcus,</hi> a <hi>Baſiliſcke.</hi> For it is more proper to Kings to cure and heale, then to kill, and ſlay. As the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited place of <hi>Eſay</hi> teacheth vs, where he that would not take the Crowne vpon him, excuſes himſelfe, not onely for that he had not bread to feede others, but alſo becauſe he was not a Phyſitian. <hi>Non ſum Medicus, &amp; in domo mea non eſt panis,</hi> preſupoſing, that a good King ought to be a Phyſitian to his people, and ought to helpe and feede his

The affection of a father towards his children, his care that they ſhall lacke no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, and to be one and the ſame towards them all, car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rieth a great proportion with a Kings pietie towards his ſubiects. Hee is called a Father, ſo that the very name, obligeth him to anſwer this ſignification, in workes, not in word; but to ſhew himſelfe a true father indeed. Againe, for that this name father is very proper vnto Kings, if wee ſhall well and truly weigh it, amongſt all other Attributes and Epithites of Maieſtie, and Signorie, it is the greateſt, vnder which all other names are comprehended, as the Species vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der their <hi>Genus,</hi> being ſubordinate thereunto. Father is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue the Title of King, Lord, Maſter, Captaine, and the like. In a word, it is a name aboue all other names that denotate

Signorie, and prouidence. Antiquitie when it was willing to throw it's greateſt Honour vpon an Emperour, it called him the Father of the Common-wealth. Which was more then <hi>Caeſar,</hi> or <hi>Auguſtus,</hi> and whatſoeuer other name moſt glorious in the world: whether it were conferr'd vpon them either for to flatter them, or to oblige them to thoſe great effects, which this name (Father) tyes them vnto. In con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion, by this word (Father,) it is giuen Kings to vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand, what they ought to doe. To wit; That they are to rule gouerne and maintaine their Common-wealths and Kingdomes in Iuſtice, and in Peace: That they are to feede, (like good ſhepheards) theſe their rationall ſheepe. That they are (like skilfull Phyſitians) to heale and cure their ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ladies: And that they are to haue that care of their ſubiects, as fathers haue of their children, watching ouer them with prudence and with Loue, reſpecting more them, then them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues. For Kings, are more obliged to the Kingdome, and the Common-wealth, then vnto themſelues. For, if we ſhall but looke into the Originall, and Inſtitution of a King, and a kingdome, we ſhall finde, that a King was ordained for the good of the kingdome, and not the kingdome for the good of the King.</p>

more colours, foldings, and doublings then any other creature whatſoeuer; worſt to be knowen, and hardeſt to to be ruled; and aboue all, moſt ingrate and vnthankfull vnto him that is ſet in authority ouer him. And <hi>Plato</hi> more particularly tells vs, that he held it in a manner a thing impoſſible, for any one to haue ſuch a Wit, that alone of himſelfe, he ſhould be ſufficient to gouerne well; it being ſo hard a matter to do, though a man haue neuer ſo good partes, and abilities to performe that function. <hi>Ptolomy,</hi> King of <hi>Aegypt,</hi> conſidering the great difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, which accompanie gouerning and reigning, began to weigh the qualitie of each difficultie, and comparing ſome with other ſome, he knew not which to ranke formoſt, or to preferre before his fellow. It ſeemed wonderfull hard vnto him, to know the Talent, and parts of perſons, for the conferring of Offices and places vpon them; a buſineſſe, whereon good gouernment mainely dependeth. Hee likewiſe found it as difficult, to make good Lawes, and Statutes. As alſo, to rule ſo many Townes, and ſo many people, as are liſted vnder a Crowne, and name of King: As likewiſe to dreſſe ſo many diſhes for ſo many different palates, ſo many things to the guſt and content of ſo many ſundry wills, and a thouſand other difficulties which daily offer themſelues in the ruling and gouerning of men. For (as <hi>Seneca</hi> ſaith) <hi>Nullum animal, maiori eſt arte tractan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dum,</hi>

No man can denie, but that to beare on his ſhoulders the weight of a kingdome, with obligation to attend on ſuch and ſo great a diuerſitie of things, as of Peace, and Warre, and of ſo many graue and weightie buſineſſe, and of ſo great importance, without fayling one point or tittle therein, is an intollerable trouble, a moſt heauy burthen, and moſt difficult Office. And in this reſpect, ſo few haue there
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:180809:21"/>
beene, that haue knowne perfectly to cumply therewith. And it is worthy our conſideration, that there being ſo many Hiſtories, and Bookes of the Liues of Kings, and Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perours of the Gentiles, there is not one amongſt them all to be found, who hath not bin noted of many faults. <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander</hi> the Great, who for his famous Acts, &amp; great Courage, had the ſirname giuen him of Great, had many things in him worthy reprehenſion, and vnbeſeeming royall dignitie.

Like vnto thoſe Bookes of <hi>Cicero,</hi> which he wrote <hi>de Oratore;</hi> Who painteth forth the properties, which hee that will be a good Orator ought to haue, though that man was neuer yet found, that had them. Beſides, if we ſhall turne our eyes to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards thoſe ancient Kings of Gods people, the ſacred Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture doth diſ-deceiue vs. For, out of the whole packe of them, hee picks out but three onely that were good.<note place="margin">Eccl. 49.5</note>

Not that theſe three had not their ſinnes, for the holy Scripture taxeth them of ſome, (and thoſe no ſmall ones) but becauſe they had not ſinned in the Office of Kings. And becauſe in it's admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration, it is an Office ſo full of difficulties: the Apoſtle S. <hi>Paul</hi> admoniſheth all the faithfull, that they alwayes make earneſt Prayers for them, which is ſtill vſed to this day in all your Catholike Churches.</p>
               <p>Moreouer that the name of a King, is the name of an Office,<note place="margin">Refran— El beneficio ſe da por el oficio.</note> it is confirmed by that common ſaying; <hi>Beneficium datur propter Officium.</hi> And therefore Kings being ſo greatly bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitted, not onely by thoſe great Tributes, which are giuen

them by the Common-wealth, but likewiſe by thoſe which they receiue from the Benefices, and Rents of the Church, it is an vndoubted truth, that they haue an Office, and of Offices the greateſt; and for this cauſe the whole King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome doth ſo freely and liberally contribute vnto them. Which is ſpecified by S. <hi>Paul</hi> in a Letter of his which hee wrote vnto the <hi>Romans.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Rom. 13.6.</note>

Let Kings therefore know, that they are to ſerue their kingdomes, being they are ſo well payd for their paines, and that they beare an Office, which tyes them neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarily to this trouble.<note place="margin">Rom. 12.8</note>

For God is no friend of feigned figures, of painted men, nor of Kings, that are onely ſo in ſhape and proportion, being in faſhion like vnto thoſe,<note place="margin">Pſal. 135. 16.</note> of whom <hi>Dauid</hi> ſayd, <hi>Os habent, &amp; non loquuntur, oculos ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bent, &amp; non videbunt, &amp;c.

And if their workes and actions doe not anſwer with their name and Title, it is as if one ſhould ſay yea, with his Mouth, and by making Signes, ſay no, with his head. What a ieſt and mockerie is this? How

It were Coſenage and deceit in that Golde beater, who writes vpon his Signe, Heere is fine gold to be ſold, when indeed it is but <hi>Orpine,</hi> and baſe gold for <hi>Painters.</hi> The name of King, is not an Attribute of Idleneſſe; A perſon regall, muſt haue reall performance.

In <hi>France,</hi> there was a time, when their kings, had nothing but the bare name of Kings, their Liuetenants Generall gouerning, and Commanding all, whileſt they (like ſo many beaſtes) did buſie themſelues in nothing elſe, but following the delights and pleaſures of Gluttonie, and Wantonneſſe. And becauſe it might be known, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare to the people, that they were aliue, (for they neuer came abroad) once a yeare they made ſhew of themſelues, on the firſt day of <hi>May,</hi> in the Market-place of <hi>Paris,</hi> ſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting in a chaire of State on a throne royall, like your kings amongſt your Stage-players; and there in reuerence they bowed their bodies vnto them, and preſented them with giftes; and they againe conferred ſome fauours, on ſuch as they though fit. And becauſe you may ſee the miſerie where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto they were brought, <hi>Eynardus,</hi> in the beginning of that Hiſtorie which he writes of the life of <hi>Charles</hi> the Great, ſays: That thoſe Kings (in thoſe dayes) had no valour in them in the world, made no ſhew of Nobleneſſe, nor gaue ſo much as a taſt of any inclination thereunto; but had onely the empty and naked name of King. For in very deede they were not Kings, nor had actually and effectually any hand in the gouernment of the State, or the wealth and riches of the Kingdome; for they were wholly poſſeſſed by the <hi>Praeſecti
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:180809:23"/>
Palatij,</hi> whom they called <hi>Seneſhalls,</hi> or Lord high Stewards of the Kings Houſe. Who were ſuch abſolute Lords and of that vnlimited power, that they ruled the roſte, and did what they liſt, leauing the poore ſeely King nothing ſaue onely the bare Title, who ſitting in a Chaire with his Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riwigge, and his long beard, repreſented the perſon of a King making the world beleeue that hee gaue Audience to all Ambaſſadours that came from forraigne parts, and gaue them their anſwers and diſpatches, when they were to returne: But in very truth, he ſayd no more vnto them, ſaue what hee had beene taught, or had by writing beene powred into him, making ſhew as if all this had beene done out of his owne Head. So that theſe kinde of Kings had nothing of the Power-Royall, but the vnprofitable name of King, and inutile throne of State, and a perſonated Maieſtie that lay open to nothing but ſcorne and deriſion. For the true kings, and thoſe that commanded all, were thoſe their <hi>Minions</hi> and <hi>Fauorites,</hi> who oppreſſed the other by their potencie, and kept them in awe. Of a King of <hi>Samaria,</hi> God ſayd; That hee was no more but <hi>paulu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lum ſpumae,</hi> a froathy bubble. Which being beheld a far off, ſeemeth to be ſomething, but when you draw neere and touch it, it is nothing. <hi>Simia in tecto, Rex fatuus, in ſolio ſuo.</hi> He is like vnto an Ape on the houſe-toppe, who vſing the apparances, and geſtures of a man is taken for ſuch a one by them that know him not. Iuſt ſo, is a fooliſh King vpon his Throne, your Ape likewiſe ſerueth to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertaine children and to make them ſport: And a King cauſeth laughter in thoſe, who behold him ſtript of the acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of a King, without authoritie, and without gouernment. A King, appareled in Purple, and ſitting with great Maieſtie in his Throne anſwereable to his greatneſſe, ſeemeth in ſhew, graue, ſeuere, and terrible, but in effect nothing. Like vnto the Picture of that <hi>Grecians</hi> limming, which being placed on high, and beheld from a farre, ſeemed
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:180809:24"/>
to be a very good Peece, But when you came neerer vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it, and viewed it well, it was full of Blots and Blurs, and very courſe ſtuffe. A King vnder his Canopie or Princely Pall, expreſſeth a great deale of outward State and Maieſtie, but himſelfe being narrowly lookt into, is no better then the blurred Character of a King. <hi>Simu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lachra gentium, Dauid</hi> calleth thoſe Kings, that are Kings onely in name. Or, as the <hi>Hebrew</hi> renders it: <hi>Imago fictilis, &amp; contrita.</hi> An image of crack't earth, which leaketh in a thouſand places.

                  <note place="margin">Iob. 4.19.</note> who, being ſo good and ſo iuſt a man, did mocke at him, vpbrayding him, that his foundation was in the duſt, that he was not a man of any ſolid and ſound iudgement, but onely had ſome certaine exteriour apparences, calling him <hi>Mimicoleon,</hi> which is a kinde of creature, which in Latin, they call <hi>Formicaleo.</hi> Becauſe it hath a monſtrous kinde of Compoſture, in the one halfe part of the body, repreſenting a fierce Lyon, which was alwayes the <hi>Hierogliffe</hi> of a King; and in the other halfe an <hi>Ante</hi> or <hi>Piſmire,</hi> which ſignifieth a weake thing and without any ſubſtance.

The moſt important and of greateſt Excellencie are thoſe of the Head; which is the ſuperiour part of the bodie. In which the Soule doth exerciſe her principall operations, as thoſe of the Vnderſtanding, and Will,<note place="margin">Ariſt. &amp; Aly. lib. <hi>3.</hi> de Anima.</note> the inſtruments whereof haue their habitation in the head.

               <p>Hence it followeth, that the Inſtitution of the State-royall, or of a King, which is repreſented in the Head, was not or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained onely for the Kings owne vſe and profit, but for the generall well-fare of his Kingdome. And therefore hee ought to See, Heare, Taſte, and vnderſtand, not only by him ſelfe, or for himſelfe, but by all, and for all. He ought not onely to haue an eye to his important affayres, but like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe to the good of his Subiects: Being that for them, and

Thoſe firſt men who leauing ſolitude, aſſembled themſelues to liue in a Community knew full well, that na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally, euery one careth for himſelfe and his owne people, but no man that taketh care for all in generall. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they did agree amongſt themſelues to chooſe one of more eſpeciall valour and worth, to whom all might haue re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe. And that he, who among them all ſhould be moſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nowned for his vertue, prudence, and fortitude, ſhould pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide ouer all the reſt, and ſhould rule and gouerne them; that he ſhould be watchfull ouer all of them, that he ſhould be ſolicitous of the common good and profit of them all, and to be as carefull of them, as a father would be of his children, or a Shepheard of his ſheepe. And weighing with themſelues, that ſuch a kinde of Man, as this ought to be, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploying himſelfe not in his owne, but other mens buſineſſes, could not be able to maintaine himſelfe, and his familie (for then all did eate of the labour of their owne hands, and the ſweate of their browes) they did ioyntly reſolue to finde his houſe, and to ſuſtaine and maintaine him,<note place="margin">Regall power was firſt orday<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned for the eaſe of the people.</note> that hee might not be withdrawen by other by buſineſſes, but apply him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe wholy to thoſe of the Common good, and to publicke gouernment. For this end were they eſtabliſhed; This was the beginning that Kings had; and it ought to be the care of a good King, to care more for the publike, then his owne particular good. All his Greatneſſe is at the coſt of a great deale of care, trouble, vexation, and inquietude both of Soule and Body. He is wearineſſe to himſelfe; to others, he is their eaſe, their ſuſtenance, and their defence. Like vnto your fayreſt flowers, and fruits, which although they beautifie the tree, they are not ſo much for it, or for it's owne reſpect, as for others. Let not any Man thinke that all the good doth
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:180809:27"/>
conſiſt in the beauty and brauery, wherewith the flower doth flouriſh; and in the goodly ſhew wherewith the Great ones of the world doe gallant it; your powerfull Kings and Princes, are flowers, but flowers which fade and wither, waſt their life to preſerue others, drawing care vpon themſelues, and affording comfort vnto others, others more inioying the fruit, then they themſelues. For (as <hi>Philon Iudaeus</hi> ſaith) A King to his Kingdome, is that, which a wiſe man to the ignorant, a ſheepheard to his ſheepe, a father to his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, light vnto darkeneſſe, and that which God heere on earth is to all his creatures.

                  </note> For to all this doth the Office and dignitie of a King oblige him. <hi>Omnium domos illius vigilantia defendit, omnium otium illius labor, omnium delitias illius induſtria, omnium vacationem illius occupatio.</hi> His ſubiects houſes are guarded and ſecured by his Vigilancie; their eaſe procured, by his labour, their delights inioyed, by his induſtry, and their merry vacations, by his painefull imployments. And therfore the Prophet <hi>Samuell</hi> ſayd vnto king <hi>Saul,</hi> anon af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter he was annointed King ouer <hi>Iſrael;</hi> declaring vnto him the obligations of his Office; Behold <hi>Saul,</hi> now that God hath annointed thee King ouer all this Kingdome, that thy Office ties thee to it's generall gouernment. Thou waſt not made King to ſleepe and take thine eaſe, or to honour and authorize thy ſelfe by the dignitie Royall, but that thou ſhouldeſt gouerne and maintaine the people in peace, and iuſtice, and that thou ſhouldeſt protect and defend them from their enemies <hi>Rex Eligitur, non vt ſui ipſius curam habeat</hi> (ſayth <hi>Socrates) et ſeſe molliter curet, Sed vt per ipſum, ij qui eligerunt, bene beatéque viuant.</hi> Kings are not choſen, that their whole care ſhould be for themſelues, to pamper the fleſh, and to liue nicely and daintily; but that by him, they who had elected him, might liue well and hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily

They were not created, nor introduced into the world, for their owne commoditie, and their owne plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, and that all the good morſels ſhould be for their owne trencher (for if it ſhould be ſo, no man would willingly be ſubiect vnto them) but for the publicke profit and common good of all his ſubiects, for their happy gouernment, for their ſafe protection, their augmentation, conſeruation, and in a word for their ſeruice; (and without any vnmannerlineſſe, we may well tearme it ſo) for albeit in outward appearance the Scepter and the Crowne, haue the face of Empire and Sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niory; yet in ſtricteneſſe and in rigour, it is but the Office of a Seruant. <hi>Servus Communis, ſiuè Servus honoratus:</hi> The Common-wealths ſeruant, or a more honourable kind of Seruant. This is the attribute which ſome giue vnto a king. <hi>Quia à tota republica ſtipendia accipit, vt ſerviat omnibus.</hi> Becauſe he receiues ſtipends from all, that he may ſerue all. <hi>And the Pope of Rome holds it no diſhonour vnto him, to be ſtiled; Servus ſervorum Dei The Seruant of Gods ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants.</hi> And howbeit anciently this name of ſeruant were infamous, yet after that our Sauiour Chriſt had in his own perſon taken it vpon him, it hath ſince beene accounted honorable. And as it is not repugnant and contradictory to the Eſſence and nature of the ſonne of God, no more is it any preiudice or diſparagement to the Maieſtie and great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of Kings. And this was well vnderſtood by <hi>Antigonus</hi> King of <hi>Macedonia,</hi> who reprehending his ſonne, for car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying too hard a hand ouer his Subiects, thus checkt his immoderate Empire; <hi>An ignoras (fili mi) Regnum noſtrum nobilem eſſe ſeruitutem?</hi> Wootſt thou not (my ſonne) that our kingdome, is a Noble ſeruitude?

                  </note> but in effect are but ſeruants and ſlaues to our Vaſſals. This is the Office of good Kings, to ſerue in this honourable manner. For, in being Kings, their Actions depend not on
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:180809:28"/>
the ſole will of their owne perſons, but of the Lawes and Statutes which they haue giuen, and allowd of, and thoſe conditions wherewith they accepted this their Soueraign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie. And though they ſhould bee wanting to theſe (which are no more then a humane Conuencion, Couenant, or agreement betwixt Prince, and people) yet may they not be defectiue in thoſe, which the naturall and diuine Law hath layd vpon them; the Lady and Miſtris as well of Kings as ſubiects. All which are in a manner contained in thoſe words of <hi>Ieremy,</hi>

This is the Summe wherein is cyphered vp the Office of a King. Theſe the Lawes of his Court, whereby he is bound to mantaine in peace and Iuſtice, the fatherleſſe, and the widowe; the poore and the rich; the mighty, and the weake. To his Account are put the <hi>Agrauios</hi> and wrongs which his Miniſters doe vnto the one; and the Iniuſtice, which the other ſuffer. The wretched eſtate of thoſe that are neceſſited, the cry of the diſtreſſed, and the teares that are ſhed out of anguiſh of heart; and a thouſand other loades, euen wane-loades of cares and obligations, lye vpon the ſhoulders of him that is the Head, and King of a kingdome. And albeit he be the head in commanding and in gouerning, yet in bearing (if not often ouercharged therewith) the heauie weight and loade of all, hee muſt be the feete or ſupporters to beare the burthen of the whole body of the Common-wealth. Of Kings and Monarkes, the iuſt men <hi>Iob</hi> ſayth; that by reaſon of their Office,<note place="margin">Iob. 9.13.</note> they carry (like Porters) the world on their
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:180809:28"/>
ſhoulders, vnder which burthen the proudeſt helpers muſt ſtoope. In conſideration whereof, it is ſayd in the booke of <hi>Wiſedome; In veſte ponderis, quam habebat ſummus ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerdos, totus erat orbis terrarum:</hi> In the long garment, was the whole world. The Latin tranſlation <hi>In veſte ponderis,</hi> car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryes more weight with it; ſo that, in taking vpon thee to be a King, thou muſt make account, to take ſo great a charge vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on thee and ſo heauie a load, as the ſtrongeſt Carte will hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be able to beare it. And this <hi>Moſes</hi> knew well enough, whom God hauing made his Vice-roy, his Captaine Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall, and ſole Liuetenant in the Gouernment; in ſtead of giuing him thankes for this ſo honourable a Charge com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted vnto him, made his moane and complaint for ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing layd ſo heauy a loade vpon his ſhoulders.<note place="margin">Numb. 11. &amp; 11.</note> 
                  <hi>Cur afflixiſti ſeruum tuum? Cur impoſuiſti pondus vniuerſi populi huius ſuper me?</hi> Wherfore haſt thou afflicted thy ſeruant? And wherefore haue I not found fauour in thy ſight, that thou layeſt the burthen of all the people vpon me?

Haue I begotten them, that thou ſhouldeſt ſay vnto me; Carry them in thy boſome, as the nurſing father beareth the ſucking child &amp;c. Where it is worthy the noting; That God ſaid not any one ſuch word vnto <hi>Moſes;</hi> But on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly commanded him, that he ſhould rule and gouerne his people, that he ſhould be their Captaine, and their Leader. And yet he heere ſticks not to ſay, that hee layd the bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then of all the people vpon him; with this <hi>Motto</hi> added thereunto; <hi>Porta eos:</hi> Carry them &amp;c. A man would thinke hee complaineth heere without a Cauſe; for God ſays no more vnto him; but that hee be their Captaine, and that hee take vpon him the rule, Command, and Gouernment of them. But to this it is anſwered. <hi>Al buen entendedor, pocas palabras:</hi> To a wiſe man, halfe a word is enough.
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:180809:29"/>
And he that is wiſe, and well vnderſtands what it is to go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerne, and to be a Head, knowes that Gouernment, and Charge, or Loade, is all one. And that the words themſelues <hi>Regere,</hi> and <hi>Portare,</hi> are Synonomyes, and haue one and the ſelfe ſame ſignification. For there is not any Gouernment, or charge, which is without it's burthen, and trouble. In that repartment and diuiſion of Offices, which <hi>Iacob</hi> conferr'd vpon his children, he marked out <hi>Reuben</hi> to be the firſt in Inheritance,<note place="margin">Gen. 49 3.</note> and the greateſt in gouernment. <hi>Prior in donis, maior in imperio:</hi> Thou art my firſt in the excellencie of dignitie,<note place="margin">Hierom. in Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc. Hebraicis in Gen.</note> &amp; the excellencie of power: which S. <hi>Ierome</hi> renders, <hi>Maior ad portandum;</hi> The greateſt to beare. For Empire, and bearing, are both one thing. And by how much the Empire is the greater, by ſo much the greater is the toyle and trouble and the burthen the heauier. St <hi>Gregory</hi> in his Moralls ſaith; That the power,<note place="margin">Gregor. lib. <hi>24.</hi> Moral. c. <hi>26.</hi>
                  </note> Dominion, and Signorie, which Kings haue ouer their ſubiects, ought not to be eſteemed an honour, but a trouble. <hi>Poteſtas accepta, non honor, ſed onus aeſtimatur.</hi> And the blindeſt Gentiles did attaine to this light of truth. And one of them vſed the ſelfe ſame phraſe of ſpeech, ſpeaking of another that was much puffed vp and well contented with the charge and office, which <hi>Apollo</hi> had allotted him.

So that to rule, and Command, is a Mixture of a little honour and much trouble. And the Latin word, which ſignifieth ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, doth not differ more then in one Letter from that which ſignifieth a loade or burthen. <hi>Onos, &amp; onus.</hi> For <hi>(H.)</hi> is but an aſpiration. Nor was there euer that man yet wanting, nor euer will be, to take (for Honours ſake) this burthen vpon him. Though all of them can be well content, to take as little of the loade as they can vpon them, but as much of the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor, as you will; howbeit this is not the ſecureſt Courſe.</p>
               <p>But I ſhall conclude this Chapter with this <hi>Aduiſo.</hi> That the Office of a King conſiſts not ſo much in the outward operation, (though in this hee is not to faile) as in the
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:180809:29"/>
inward apprehenſion. Which in it's own nature may imbrace infinite things, not as infinite, but as ſuch as may be reduced to a few points, nor no more then ſhall be pointed at in this Treatiſe. Which ought alwayes, of a wiſe &amp; prudent King, to be well vnderſtood, &amp; to make vſe of as many of them as hee can, and which do more particularly appertaine vnto his Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, and to leaue the reſt vnto his Miniſters. A King muſt be like the Heart in the Body, which ſolely of it ſelfe cannot per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme all thoſe offices, which all the members more particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly may. But by the helpe and meanes of diuers Inſtruments, members, and Organs, diffuſing &amp; ſending forth their vertue vnto them, it findes it ſelfe in the operation of them all. The king, is the heart of the kingdome, and muſt worke therin like it, not doing all by himſelfe (for that is impoſſible, and inſtead of doing good, would do hurt) by keeping himſelfe in his proper Station, without tranſiliating that Circle which more particularly belongeth vnto him, and performing thoſe Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, which another cannot execute for him, by his great power and vertue, he may in a diffuſiue manner haue recourſe to all the parts euen the moſt remote of his kingdome, take a care of all and haue a hand in all. And this care, is as proper to a King; as it is to the heart; it being impoſſible for the heart to liue without care. And from thence it takes it's name and Appellatiue. <hi>Cor</hi> (ſaith <hi>Iſidore) dicitur à cura,</hi>

                  <hi>CHAP. V.</hi> Of the reaſon and vnderſtanding of Kings, and of their wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome.</head>
               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>N good and true Philoſophy, and the beſt receiued Diuinity, it is auerred, that the vnderſtanding and naturall rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon is the moſt principall power that is in Man, by which he is diſtinguiſhed from Beaſts; and is the <hi>principium &amp; radix,</hi> the ground and root of wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome. And by how much the more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genious a man is, &amp; of better vnderſtanding, by ſo much the more is he capable thereof, and the more intenſiuely doth he loue it. And for this cauſe did <hi>Pythagoras</hi> call wiſe men Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophers, Louers, or coueters of Wiſdome; becauſe the poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion thereof doth ſet an edge on the deſire, and makes a man to couet it the more, for it's treaſure is infinite, and no man can exhauſt it. And therefore the more a man hath of it, the more he deſireth it. It is the retreit and receptacle of faith, and of all the Arts and Sciences, both practicke and ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culatiue, hauing an vniuerſall aptitude to receiue them all in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it ſelfe, and vpon the apprehenſion of them to put them in execution. And although it be a <hi>potentia</hi> or faculty of a li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mited power, yet ſo great is it's capacity, and of that ample<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and ableneſſe to receiue and containe, that it ſeemeth infinite, for let a man know neuer ſo much, yet can he not fill vp his knowledge. For ſuch and ſuch notions diſpoſe the vnderſtanding for others. Knowledge begetteth knowledge, and the more things a man knoweth, ſo much the more eaſily doth he apprehend thoſe he knoweth not, till he come to the perfect inquiry and knowledge of the truth: and by
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:180809:31"/>
conuerſing with the wiſe, and exerciſe of good Letters, hee goes ſtill riſing higher and higher. And by how much the more a man is aduanced in his vnderſtanding, ſo much the more aduantage ſhall he haue of thoſe which haue not the ſame meaſure. Suting with that ſaying of the Comicke <hi>Poet,</hi> who wondering to ſee the great difference betweene man &amp; man, cryes out, <hi>Homo, homini quid praeſtat!</hi> So much doth one man differ from another in wiſdome and prudence, that they ſeeme to be different <hi>ſpecies.</hi> And hence is it that the aduantage which a wiſe man hath ouer thoſe that are not ſo, is, to make him King ouer all the people. Which leſſon God taught vs in the firſt King he made choice of for his people, who ſtanding in the midſt of his Subiects, was taller then any of them from the ſholders vpwards, ſo that his head ſhew'd it ſelfe aboue them all.<note place="margin">1 Sam. 10.28.</note> And the word <hi>Melech</hi> which in the originall ſignifieth a king, in that large &amp; eminent Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter which ſtands in the midſt of it, doth miſtically giue vs to vnderſtand the excellency that aboue others, Kings ought to haue. And therefore <hi>Plato</hi> ſtiled a prudent and wiſe Gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, <hi>Virum divinum,</hi> a diuine man; preſuppoſing that he ſhould be ſomewhat more then a man, and exceed in diuine wiſedome all other Gouernours whatſoeuer. <hi>Vbi ſapiens, ibi eſt Deus in humano corpore.</hi> And therefore, as God by way of eminency containeth the perfections of all the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures; ſo, (as farre forth as a Creature can) a wiſe King ſhould (and that with much aduantage) poſſeſſe the perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions of all his people. And the holy Scripture teacheth vs, that God created man after his own image and likeneſſe, giuing him Vnderſtanding, Memory, and Will. And ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing created him,<note place="margin">Gen. 1.26.</note> made him King ouer all he had created. <hi>Vt praeſit piſcibus Maris, &amp; volatilibus Coeli, &amp; beſtijs vniverſae Terrae, &amp;c.</hi> To haue dominion ouer the Fiſh of the Sea, and ouer the Fowle of the Aire, &amp; ouer the Cattle, &amp;c. And this was granted him, and did accompany the common nature of men. But to rule, and command, to be Lord, and Gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:180809:31"/>
ouer men themſelues, (as are Kings) is a farre greater matter, and ſuch as requireth a greater meaſure of Vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding and Wiſedome: and he that hath moſt ſtore there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, ſhall reape the moſt profit by it, as he that wants it, ſhall contrarywiſe finde the lacke of it. <hi>Salomon,</hi> the wiſeſt of Kings, as he was both wiſe, and a King, could better then any other informe vs, of what importance are Vnderſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding and Wiſdome in Kings. In whoſe name he ſpeaketh, when he ſaith, <hi>Per me Reges regnant,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Prou. 8.15.</note> 
                  <hi>per me Principes impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant; By me Kings reigne, and Princes decree iuſtice.</hi> To the wiſeman the Scepter and Crowne of right belongeth. For wiſdome her ſelfe, as being the moſt eſſentiall forme of Kings, makes him King and Monarch ouer others. And in all Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions almoſt, they gaue the ſame name, and the ſame Enſignes to Empire and Wiſdome. And <hi>S. Paul</hi> makes them <hi>Synono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,</hi> and will haue them to ſignifie one and the ſame thing. She alone (by keeping Gods commandements) will be ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient in a King to make him pleaſing and acceptable vnto God, and to be cut out according to the meaſure of his own heart. And though ſome are of a larger heart and vnderſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding then other ſome; yet (with God) to be wiſe, is that which conueneth moſt both to King and Subiect.</p>
               <p>By <hi>Eſay</hi> the Prophet God promiſeth to all his people a golden age, happy dayes, and fortunate times, wherein all ſhall haue a ſhare of happineſſe, peace, equity, iuſtice, health, content, and abundance of fruits. But comming vnto Kings, he ſaith no more, but that there ſhall not be any one that ſhall be a foole. <hi>Non vocabitur vltrà is qui inſipiens eſt, Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceps.</hi> This is a great happineſſe. But (O Lord) let mee aske thee; Is a King of worſe condition then his Subiects, that thou ſhouldſt promiſe ſo many good things vnto them, and but one alone vnto him? The anſwere hereunto is, that our good God giueth vnto euery one (according to his ſtate and calling) that which is fitteſt for him. The Subiect who hath one to rule and gouerne him, hath need of one to
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:180809:32"/>
miniſter iuſtice vnto him, to conſerue him in peace, and to make ſuch prouiſion, that he may haue wherewith to eate, and the like. But a King, who is to rule and gouerne, hath need of wiſedome, which is the life and ſoule of Kings, which ſuſtaineth the weight of a Kingdome, and without which (be they neuer ſo rich, neuer ſo powerfull) they ſhall be as fit for gouernment, as a body without a head, or an head without a ſoule. And as from the ſoule the Sences are origined, and from that eſſence reſult your paſſions; ſo in like ſort from wiſedome reſulteth vnto King, and Kingdome, all that good and happineſſe that can be deſired.<note place="margin">Wiſd. 6. 24.</note> 
                  <hi>Rex ſapi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ens, ſtabilimentum eſt Ciuitatis.

You ſhall not name that Nation either barbarous, or ciuill, which (where Kings were made by election) did not make choice of a wiſe and prudent King.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Iudg. 9.8.</note>In that generall Dyet, where all the Nations of Trees and Plants met, ſeeing that without Law, and without a King, they could not conſerue themſelues in peace, and iuſtice; the firſt reſolution they tooke, was to chooſe a wiſe King. And in the firſt place they nominated the <hi>Oliue,</hi> a tree of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny good parts and qualities; and amongſt other, this the chiefeſt, that it was the Symbole or Hierogliffe of wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, which is all whatſoeuer can be deſired in a King.</p>

                  <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> tearmed the <hi>Thebans</hi> happy,<note place="margin">Membrin. Roſi. cap. <hi>33.</hi>
                  </note> all the while that they were gouerned by thoſe that were wiſe. Of ſuch conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence is wiſedome in a King, that vpon the very rumour that he is a wiſe Prince, all preſently obay, and ſooner ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit themſelues, then at the noiſe of his power. As was to be ſeene in King <hi>Salomon,</hi> whoſe wiſedome was no ſooner knowen to the people, but they began preſently to reſpect and feare him.</p>
               <p>But let me aske this queſtion: Shall it ſuffice a King to haue vnderſtanding and wiſdome, vnleſſe he make vſe there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, and ſhew a willingneſſe to execute what he knowes? No certainly. For the greatneſſe of a power or faculty conſiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth in it's operation. The Vnderſtanding without Intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, (like the Will without Loue) ſerues to little or no purpoſe. And it is doubted (as I toucht in the beginning) vpon which of theſe two <hi>potentias,</hi> or faculties, is that arme and hand, whereby the ſoule operateth it's moſt excellent workes? The vnderſtanding alleageth for himſelfe, that it is he that in the kingdome of our ſoule doth ordaine, diſpoſe, and gouerne. The Will, ſhe ſaith, that without her nothing is done. For as the Philoſophers tearme it, <hi>Applicat poten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tias ad operandum,</hi> ſhe ſets theſe faculties a worke, and findes them hands. The Vnderſtanding confeſſeth this is true; but with all ſaith, it is he that nods and winckes vpon her, makes ſignes and tokens vnto her, is as it were the Watch-word, &amp; doth expoſe vnto her whether ſhe will this or that, for the better ordering &amp; diſpoſing of it. The Will, ſhe on the other ſide replyes, that ſhe likewiſe fomenteth and affectionates the Vnderſtanding, and doth excite and ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licite him, that he ſtudy, thinke, and dwell vpon that which ſhe beſt liketh. But leauing the reſolution of this Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſie to your <hi>Thomiſts,</hi> and <hi>Scotiſts,</hi> who diſpute it at large; the Vnderſtanding (as I ſaid before) is a Regall power which ruleth &amp; gouerneth in man, and is that Starre which guideth
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:180809:33"/>
and giueth light to the whole houſe of the ſoule; yet is the Will ſo much Miſtreſſe, that nothing is done without her. Nor can God himſelfe (by violence) draw a yea, or a nay from it, without treſpaſſing vpon that liberty where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with he created it; for in it's owne nature it is free: and (as Philoſophy informeth vs) it cannot be forced. <hi>Caeterae po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentiae poſſunt capi, non tamen voluntas.</hi> But the common receiued opinion is, that both the one and the other muſt concurre for the effecting of any free worke. Inſomuch, that it is impoſſible to performe any action of importance, vnleſſe that both doe intend the ſame. We muſt plucke the reynes of both, hold both of them in our hands, if we meane to rule and gouerne the ſoule as we ought; the Vnderſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding directing, and the Will operating. And therefore a deuout King, after that hee hath begg'd vnderſtanding of God, that hee may be able to ſtudy and meditate on the obſeruance of his diuine Law, for the conſeruation of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, and his kingdome; finding that this is not ſufficient if the Will ſhould draw another way, let him preſently pray vnto him, that he incline his Will, and ſo diſpoſe thereof, that he may not onely will his Will, but that hee may take pleaſure to put it in practiſe. In ſtrictneſſe, and in rigour, that is not Wiſedome, nor deſerueth the name thereof, which is bung'd vp in the Head, and goes not from the Vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding to the hand, and from the Will to the Worke. <hi>Non enim ſapientia eſt</hi> (ſaith <hi>S. Bernard) quae quod ſapit, non exercet; Wiſedome without practiſe is not Wiſedome.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There are ſome of whom all men ſticke not to ſay, that he is of great vnderſtanding, a man of admirable abilities, ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular wiſedome, &amp;c. And yet no man knowes wherein his Knowledge lies, nor can diſcerne his Wiſdome in his Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. It is neceſſary that this opinion ſhould be ratified and confirmed by exterior Actions, and ſome publique demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrations. Of King <hi>Dauid</hi> the holy Ghoſt ſaith, that hee did gouerne his people with the vnderſtanding of his hands.
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:180809:33"/>
                  <hi>Et in intellectibus manuum ſuarum deduxit illos.</hi> It is a cleare caſe that the hands haue no other particular vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding in a diſtinct manner, or diſtinguiſhed from that which the ſoule hath; and this is in the Head, and not in the hands. But the meaning of that place is, that in the Workes of his hands, and in all his Actions, the King manifeſted his great Vnderſtanding and Wiſedome: Which if it remaine onely in the huske, or ſhell, it is good for nothing. <hi>Sicut fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des, ita &amp; ſapientia, ſine operibus mortua eſt; Wiſedome</hi> (ſaith <hi>S. Bernard) is like Faith, without good Workes it is dead.</hi> That King therefore that ſhall haue wiſedome inough in, and for himſelfe, and ſhall execute and ſhew the ſame in the gouernment of his kingdome, and exerciſe the ſame a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt his Subiects, he ſhall be great in all his kingdomes heere on Earth, and great likewiſe in the kingdome of Heauen.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Salomon,</hi> when God had giuen him wiſedome, did not onely attend the ſpeculatiue part, but the practicke; which is the principall thing in him that ruleth.<note place="margin">Eccl. 8.16.</note> 
                  <hi>Appoſui cor me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um, vt viderem ſapientiam, &amp; occupationem:</hi> (for ſo the Septuagint tranſlate it.) But rendered by the vulgar: <hi>I ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed mine heart to know wiſdome, and to ſee the buſineſſe that is done vpon Earth;</hi> for in Wiſedome, and the good exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe thereof, conſiſteth all the good gouernment of a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth. This being preſuppoſed, and what elſe in the ſubſequent Chapters ſhall be ſpoken hereof, I ſay, That it is not required of Kings, that they ſhould be ſo wiſe and skilfull in all Arts and Faculties, as King <hi>Salomon</hi> was, and others, which make profeſſion thereof; nor yet ſo illiterate, as the Emperour <hi>Licinius,</hi> which was ſuch an Idiot, and ſuch a beaſt, that he knew not how to firme or ſet his hand to any Deed, or Writing. Or as that other <hi>Michael Balbo,</hi> which was ſuch an enemy vnto Learning, that hee would neither ſtudy good Letters himſelfe, nor ſuffer the children of his time to be bred vp therein.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="46" facs="tcp:180809:34"/>That which is to be required of euery good King, is; that he haue ſo much wiſedome, as to be able to aduiſe himſelfe, and to make benefit of the Councell of others. That he be wiſe enough to know what is good and iuſt, and what is bad and ill, that he may vſe the one, and ſhun the other. <hi>Is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nim moderatus eſt ſapiens</hi> (ſaith <hi>Socrates</hi>) that hath Courage to execute, and Will to doe. On thoſe Baſes, which the moſt wiſe King <hi>Salomon</hi> placed in the Temple,<note place="margin">1 Kings 7.29.</note> hee commanded Lions, Oxen, and Cherubins to be ingrauen, in ſignificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of ſo many the like qualities which Kings ought to haue, who ſuſtaine the whole weight of a kingdome. He muſt be in perpetuall labour, ſignified in the Oxe; he muſt be endued with courage, expreſſed in the Lion; and he muſt abound in knowledge, notified in the Cherubin. Wherfore <hi>Cicero</hi> like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe maketh mention;<note place="margin">Cicero in Orat. pro lege Manil.</note> 
                  <hi>Hae ſunt</hi> (ſaith that Heathen Orator) <hi>virtutes Imperatoriae, Labor in negotijs, Fortitudo in peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culis, Induſtria in agendo:</hi> To aſſiſt in buſineſſes, to be ſtout and valiant in dangers, to be dextrous and wiſe in acting, and aboue all, to haue a liberall will without ſubiection, and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily diſpoſed for execution, are vertues befitting an Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour. For to gouerne well, great ſtrength, great courage, great wiſedome, great power, and a great willingneſſe will be required. For, though a King know much, and can doe much; yet, if he will not exerciſe his knowledge, nor make vſe of his power, it is all one as if he neither knew, nor could doe any thing. The Leaper ſaid to our Sauiour Chriſt, <hi>Domine, ſi vis, potes me mundare; If thou wilt, thou canſt make me cleane.</hi> And Chriſt made him anſwer, not in word onely, but in deed; <hi>Volo, mundare; I will, be thou cleane.</hi>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>N regard that the Vnderſtanding is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt all other faculties the Nobleſt, it is that (without doubt) which doth leaſt render and yeeld it ſelfe, but is moſt ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cible of the offence it receiueth in ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting it ſelfe. Whereupon oftentimes it ſticketh cloſe to it's opinion, and what it hath once intertained, it obſtinately maintaineth and defendeth. And therefore the Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher, ſaid; <hi>Amicus Plato, ſed maior Veritas: Plato</hi> is my friend, but the truth more. In confirmation whereof we daily ſee, that the deareſt and neereſt friends, and that are one and the ſame in their will and affection, in their vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding and opinion are diuerſe and different. Each of them maintaineth his owne particular Tenet, and yet without offence continew ſtill good friends. In a word, in matter of Knowledge and Vnderſtanding, becauſe it is a thing that cannot be meaſured out by the yard, or meate out by inches, there is not that Man, that can indure <hi>Maioria,</hi> or that another ſhould goe before him, or get the ſtart of him in that kinde. Euery one reſteth ſatisfied with his owne Vnderſtanding, and conceiues that his reaſon is the beſt; and few will bee brought to acknowledge, that they are in an errour. And in a manner all men flatter themſelues with their owne opinion, and thinking they are in the right, they are ſo farre from yeelding, that they ſtiffely maintaine what they haue vndertaken &amp; you ſhall not beate them out of it, as being perſwaded that they haue the better end of the

Counſaile, and companie of thoſe which were not ſo, were very preiudiciall and hurtfull. Counſailours likewiſe muſt be of that greatneſſe of courage and magnanimitie, as may cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſpond with the Dignitie royall. For Kings that haue not had in themſelues any great courage, haue ſtill honoured noble-minded Counſailours, whereas the contrary haue bin diſgraced, and degraded of their honours by Kings that were naturally magnanimous. For it is the condition of coward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly hearts, and of baſe Counſailours <hi>en cuerpo, y alma</hi> (as they ſay) in body, and ſoule; to propoſe vnto their Kings baſe and vnworthy meanes, for the remedying of ſome miſchiefes, whereon others follow, that are farre greater. And let them not perſwade them, that this Age is barraine of ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous diſpoſitions, and Noble mindes, which produceth, as well as former times, whatſoeuer is neceſſary and needefull for them. For, the diuine prudence (to which particularly appertaineth the conſeruation of kingdoms) is neuer drawen dry, neuer waxes weary. And if ſuch men are wanting, and appeare not to the eye of the world, it is, becauſe they are not ſought after, or not admitted to Councell, for the chaſtiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and puniſhment of our great and heinous ſinnes. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, this one benefit Kings haue aboue others, that all good men would be glad to ſerue them, and many do ſue and ſeeke after them, and offer their ſeruice vnto them; So that, they haue ſtore of choiſe, and may eaſily make good election, if therein they will ſtrip and cleanſe themſelues of their affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and paſſions, which Eclipſe and darken the true iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of man. And theſe, that I now ſpeake of, when they haue found them, and made choiſe of them to be of their Councell; let them loue them, honour them, and truſt them. And as they ſhall receiue eaſe and honour by their good Aduiſe; So let them reward them, and conceiue of them, as king <hi>Alexander</hi> did of his Maſter, and Counſellour <hi>Ariſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle,</hi> of whom he ſaid, that he ought no leſſe reſpect vnto him, then vnto his owne father. For from his father he had his
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:180809:40"/>
life, his honour, and his kingdome; but from <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> his Inſtructions, Counſailes, and directions, how he ſhould or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der himſelfe in all his affaires. And <hi>Scipio,</hi> doth attribute all the honour of his Victories to his faithfull friend and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſellour <hi>Laelius.</hi> And <hi>Cicero,</hi> to the Philoſopher <hi>Publius,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Cicero lib. <hi>4.</hi> epiſt. fam. epiſt. vltima.</note> for thoſe notable things of his gouernment, which he perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med in his Conſullſhip: ſo that good and faithfull Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſailours, are of great honour, profit, and eaſe vnto Kings. But let Kings take heede, leaſt they ſtrike a feare into their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelours, through their abſolute and free condition, and make them to withdraw themſelues from aduiſing them what is fitting, by ſeeing them ſo wedded to their owne opinion, and to excuſe themſelues from giuing Counſaile, for that they are diſ-heartned &amp; diſcountenanced by them for deliuering their mindes freely for their profit, &amp; honour. Of the Emperour <hi>Adrian</hi> it is ſtoryed, that hee had ſo noble a condition, <hi>Vt libenter patiebatur admoneri &amp; corrigi vel ab humili perſona:</hi> That he willingly ſubmitted himſelfe to be admoniſhed and reproued of the meaneſt perſon. It is proper to gentile breſts, &amp; generous hearts, to liſten with delight to the good reaſons, &amp; Counſailes of others, though they be inferiour in qualitie vnto them: for ſometimes a poore man hits right, when a rich man miſſes the marke. And a Country Clowne may aduiſe that, which a king knowes not of. And if he do perſwade him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, that he knoweth all, and vnderſtandeth all, and that his opinion alone is the certaineſt &amp; ſureſt, he but ſhuts the doore to the diſcouery of his errour. One of the two things (ſaith <hi>Heſiod</hi>) which euery man of reaſon, wiſdome, and vnderſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, that ſhall be ſufficient to gouerne that, which ſhall be committed to his charge, ought to haue; is a great blandure, ſmoothneſſe, and ſoftneſſe of heart, to follow the opinion, aduiſe and Counſaile of thoſe that are the wiſeſt and know moſt. This <hi>blandure,</hi> and <hi>docilitie,</hi> is likewiſe a part of Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, and we ſhall finde it ſet downe in expreſſe words, in thoſe two Petitions, which <hi>Salomon</hi> made vnto God. For in

the ſecond of the <hi>Chron.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">2. Chron. 2.10.</note> It is written, that he ſayd; <hi>Da mihi ſapientiam: Giue me wiſedome.</hi> And in the firſt of the <hi>Kings; Dabis ergo ſeruo tuo cor docile:</hi>

For, by following bad Counſaile, he ſhall erre as much, as if he fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed his owne proper errour; and ſometimes more. And I ſhould hold it the leſſe euill, that a king were not ouerwiſe, if preſuming that he is; he ſhould relie too much vpon himſelf, &amp; ſcorne to take counſaile; then if he were leſſe wiſe, but knew how to benefit himſelfe, and make good vſe of the Aduiſe of prudent and wiſe Counſailours.<note place="margin">Aug. lib. <hi>14.</hi> de Ciuit.

<pb n="61" facs="tcp:180809:41"/>
ſaying; That Kings for to hit the nayle on the head, &amp; not to faile in the carriage of their buſineſſes, muſt alwaies take cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaile of wiſemen, ſuch as are of knowne vertue &amp; experience; and not giue credit vnto any, that prate &amp; talke with a great deale of liberty &amp; licence of thoſe things they vnderſtand not, as if they were graduated in the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> from their Mothers wombe; And only for a more happy (in ſhew) than prudent wit: Leſt that happen vnto them, which befell king <hi>Ahab,</hi> who admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to his Councell a falſe Prophet, that made great often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of that ſpirit, which hee had not. Hee put the gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment into his hands, &amp; all was gouerned by his Counſaile. And becauſe he did not ſpeake by the ſpirit of God, nor hee himſelfe well vnderſtood what he ſaid, buſineſſes we<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t amiſſe, the kingdome ſuffered, &amp; it coſt the king his life. It paſſeth ſo ſometimes that Kings put the gouernment into thoſe mens hands which are lame, &amp; neither know nor can command. They require their voice, who haue nothing but a voice: emp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty barrels that ſound loud, but haue no fulneſſe, &amp; craue ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of thoſe that are leaſt able to giue it them. And if they the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues pay not for their folly, yet at leſt the kingdome ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers for it.

And this the Prophet <hi>Micaiah</hi> teacheth vs in a viſion w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> he had, in this forme:<note place="margin">1 King. 22.19.</note> God repreſented himſelf, ſitting on his Throne, and all the Hoaſt of Heauen ſtanding by him, on his right hand, and on his left, conſulting with them, what courſe hee ſhould take to deſtroy <hi>Ahab.</hi> And euery one hauing deliuered his opinion, there came forth a malignant and lying ſpirit,
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:180809:42"/>
like another <hi>Cayphas,</hi> and gaue his verdit, ſaying; <hi>I will goe forth, and I will be a lying ſpirit in the mouth of all his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets I will inſtruct the Counſailours of King Ahab, and with a lye cloathed with the appearance and likeneſſe of truth, I will deceiue and deſtroy him.</hi> This courſe was approued, and held to be the fitteſt &amp; moſt effectuall for the kings vtter ruine and deſtruction. And albeit in this diuine Viſion, and reuelation, manifeſted for the diſ-deceiuing of Kings, and to put them out of their errour, there were many things worthy obſerua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and conſideration, yet the principall note, (in my iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment) is; That neither <hi>Ahabs</hi> want of vnderſtanding, nor his being head-ſtrong nor wilfull in his opinion, nor his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ouer-raſh, and vnaduiſed in what he vndertooke, but his own ſins, and the ſins of his people, had put him in that eſtate and condition, that diſmeriting Gods fauour, and the light of heauen, the diuel did deceiue him, guiding the tongues of his falſe Prophets, telling them falſehoods, for truthes; doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full things, for things certaine, and by perſwading him, that that which was to be his deſtruction, ſhould turne vnto his profit &amp; honour. <hi>S. Paul</hi> tells vs,<note place="margin">2. Cor. 11.15.</note> that Satan often times tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formes himſelfe into an Angell of Light, and repreſents lyes and falſhoods vnto vs, in the ſhape &amp; figure of truth. And the miſchiefe of it, is; That the ſame which the diuell wrought vpon <hi>Ahabs</hi> Counſailours, feigned friends, and profeſſed ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, haue, and doe the like on ſome occaſions; procuring by ſecret meanes, to introduce perſons, who making profeſſion to ſide and take part with the king, perſwade him to do that, which is leaſt fitting for them, and moſt vſefull for their own ends. This is one of the greateſt darings, and inſolencies, that may in matter of State be attempted. God free all good kings from ſuch Counſailes, and Counſailours. When king <hi>Dauid</hi> ſaw how his ſonne <hi>Abſolon</hi> perſecuted him, and thought to go away with the kingdome, he feared not any thing ſo much, as the plots and Counſaile of <hi>Achitophel,</hi> who was both a ſubtile Statiſt, and a valiant Souldier, and by whoſe aduiſe <hi>Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolon</hi>
                  <pb n="64" facs="tcp:180809:43"/>
was wholly ruled and gouerned. For the repairing of which miſchiefe, he got <hi>Huſhai</hi> the <hi>Archite,</hi> who was no whit inferiour vnto him in valour, and prudence, in a diſſembling and diſguiſed manner, to offer his ſeruice vnto <hi>Abſalon,</hi> and to worke himſelfe in to be of his Councell of war, and State, that he might be the better able, to oppoſe the able and ſound aduice of <hi>Achitophel;</hi> as he did euen then, when his Maſter had moſt need of his ſeruice: By which diſcreete carriage, <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid</hi> was freed of his feare,<note place="margin">2. Sam. 15.31.</note> and <hi>Abſalons</hi> buſineſſes went back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, till himſelfe, and his whole Armie were vtterly ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thrown. Which ſtory ye may read more at large in the ſecond of <hi>Samuel.</hi> Two things therefore are to be conſidered for to know which is the beſt and ſafeſt Counſaile: The one on the Kings part, who craues it; the other, on his part, that giues it. And on either part, that which moſt importeth, is pureneſſe of intention, &amp; a deſire to incounter with Truth. Not like vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to thoſe, who hearken vnto good and diſappaſſionated Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſailes with paſſion, and onely deſire to be aduiſed, that the Councell may conclude, what is meerely their Wil, &amp; not o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe. And in their ſittings at the Counſaile-Table, which are ordained to this end, they doe not ſo much treate, whether that, they pretend, be iuſt, or no? but with what colour of Iuſtice, they may effect what they deſire? The vnderſtanding (ſaith <hi>Saluſt</hi>) which we will (and with better reaſon, or more properly) tearme the Will, ought to be free and diſ-incum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>branced of affection, or particular paſſions, as well in asking, as giuing Counſaile. And becauſe if there be any of this reig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning in the breſt, it cannot alwaies, nay ſcarce any long time be diſſembled, but will like fire breake forth from vnder the aſhes that couer it; fitting it is, That Kings ſhould ſeldome aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt perſonally in Counſaile; for their Voting in his preſence, is done with awfulneſſe, and great reſpect; but in his abſence, they vtter their mindes with alittle more freenes, and libertie of language. And euermore your firſt opinions of your Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters, and Counſailours of State, before they be toucht with
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:180809:43"/>
the Ayre of the Kings will, are the beſt and the ſincereſt, as produced from that vnforſt motion and naturall inclination, which is in their owne particular hearts, and boſomes. If the King deſireth to haue this or that thing paſſe, and for to au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorize and qualifie this his deſire, he craueth their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell, howbeit hee meete with many which conforme them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues thereunto, &amp; follow his guſt and liking, yet ſuch Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaile or aduice in ſuch a Caſe, ought to be eſteemed as little ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure, as there is great reaſon for it to hold it ſuſpected: Eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially, if the foreſaid Counſailours, by ſome meanes or other come to haue an inckling, that this way the King is inclined, and this is that, which will giue him content. And though we might as well out of Diuine, as Humane Letters cite heere many examples, for that this is a thing ſo vſuall, and ſo well receiued both by Princes, and by Priuy-Counſailours; Or to ſpeake more truly and plainely, by thoſe, that ſooth, and flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter them; I will onely alleadge that, which paſſed with that vnfortunate King <hi>Ahab;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1. Kings. 21.6.</note> who out of his proud and haughty ſpirit, and the deſire that he had to make warre, and to take a place of importance from the King of <hi>Syria,</hi> propounded his intent, or to ſay better his Content, to thoſe of his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell. The buſineſſe was no ſooner in treatie, and the propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition for the vndertaking of this action propoſed vnto them, but forthwith 400. Counſailours with a ioynt conſent con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed themſelues to his opinion. And to ſooth vp this his humour the more, one amongſt the reſt bobb'd him in the mouth with an intollerable Lye, affirming; that God had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uealed vnto him, that he ſhould haue the glorie of the day, &amp; that the ſucceſſe of the battaile ſhould be proſperous vnto him This was apprehended with a great deale of content by the King, but was finiſhed with his vnfortunate end, himſelfe being ſlaine in that battaile, and his Army routed and ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throwne. By which we may ſee, how much it concerneth Kings, if they will receiue good Counſaile, that they diſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble (as much as they can) their particular good will and
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:180809:44"/>
liking in the buſineſſe propoſed. But that, which is heere of greater conſideration, is the vertue, fidelitie, and truth of a Counſailour, a minde without paſſion, diſintereſſed, and pure. For it oftentimes hapneth, that he that craueth Counſaile, hath not his intention ſo ſound as is requiſite, nor his iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſo ſtrong, as to reduce him into the right way, and being ſet in it, to follow the beſt. But to grow to a Concluſion, that cannot faile, which Truth it ſelfe, our Sauiour Chriſt ſaid in his Goſpell; <hi>A good tree, cannot bring forth had fruit: nor a bad tree good.</hi> And the badge or cogniſance of good or bad Counſaile, ſhall doubtleſſe be the goodneſſe, or badneſſe, the wiſedome, or ignorance of the Counſailour. And therefore I importunately preſſe, that it mainly importeth a Prince, to beware, of whom he taketh Counſaile. For by how much the more profitable is a wiſe &amp; vpright Counſailour, by ſo much the more preiudiciall is he, that is vniuſt, and vnſtreight. And therefore the Holy Ghoſt ſaith;<note place="margin">Tob. 4.19.</note> 
                  <hi>Conſilum ſemper à ſapiente perquire: Aske Counſaile alwaies of the wiſe.</hi> And in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther place;<note place="margin">Eccl. 6.6.</note>

A cleare Example wherof we haue in King <hi>Rehoboam,</hi> the ſonne and ſucceſſour of King <hi>Salo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon,</hi> who though he ſucceeded his father in ſo rich a King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, and ſo inured to peace, and obedience to their King, yet notwithſtanding was in an inſtant vndone &amp; vtterly loſt by bad both Counſaile, and Counſailours. For good Counſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours, are the life and ſoule of a Kingdome. And when it is not vnderpropped with ſuch, like a body without a ſoule, it pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently ſinkes &amp; falls from it's ſtate wherin it ſtood.

But the miſchiefe of it is; That in Elections, wee many times ſee the contrary, and what a ſtrange diuorce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and ſeperation there is heerein, from this true Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phie. For that, which now a dayes moſt of all diſcouers it ſelfe in theſe Elections, is our proper guſt, will, and affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. And therefore to remedy ſo great a malady, it ſhall be
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:180809:45"/>
requiſite, that the Prince, who deſireth to tread ſure, to hit the marke he aymes at, and to pleaſe God in thoſe whom he electeth and calleth to his Counſell: that hee follow the Example of our Sauiour Chriſt, written for our inſtruction by the Euangeliſts <hi>S. Mathew,</hi> and <hi>S. Luke,</hi> who recounting the Election of <hi>S. Peter</hi> and of <hi>S. Andrew,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Mat. 4. Luk. 4. &amp;. 5.</note> and other the Apoſtles, as his principall Miniſters, there preceded a long and prolixe Oration, or prayer, full of feruour, of zeale, and of the Spirit, and retyred himſelfe into the deſart, and there faſted 40. dayes,<note place="margin">Luk. 6.12.</note> 
                  <hi>Et erat pernoctans in Oratione Dei.</hi> And continued all night in prayer vnto God. Which (as <hi>S. Ambroſe,</hi> and other fathers haue well obſerued) Chriſt did not doe, that hee had any neede of theſe Diſpoſitions, and Preambles, for to iumpe right in that Election; but to teach kings, and all other Princes, that if they will hit right in their Elections, they are to vſe the like Diligences. They are by good and pious workes to procure this fauour at Gods hands, and to direct all their actions to this end. Nor would hee, that this Election ſhould be left wholly to the declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of thoſe Saints, for our Sauiour did declare himſelfe more particularly in the 10. of <hi>S. Luke;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Luk. 10.2.</note> Where ſpeaking with the 70 Diſciples, which had nominated them, he ſayd vnto them; <hi>Meſſis quidem multa, operarij autem pauci; rogate ergo Dominum Meſſis, vt mittat operarios in meſſem ſuam: The Harueſt truly is great, but the Labourers are few; Pray yee therefore the Lord of the Harueſt, that hee would ſend forth Labourers into his Harueſt.</hi> And though in thoſe former times, theſe words were very ſeaſonable, yet now in this preſent age, it's neceſſitie is better knowne, as likewiſe the truth thereof. For, the Harueſts being ſo many, and ſo great, I meane, ſo great and ſo many the varietie, and multitude of important buſineſſes for the welfare of the Common-wealth, the Labourers are very few. But to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe my ſelf a little more fully, I ſay, That very few are they, that enter, or ſeeke to enter into Offices, for to labour and
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:180809:45"/>
paines, but for to liue at their pleaſure, &amp; to heape vp riches, that they may increaſe the more in ambition, and more freely take their eaſe. The remedie of this, conſiſteth in that, which our Sauiour Chriſt commandeth vs; To wit: That we indefa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigably pray vnto him, that he will be pleaſed to ſend forth faithfull Miniſters and good Labourers into his Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth. Miniſters, of knowen truſt, zeale, &amp; vertue, to whom may ſute the name of Counſellours, and not of Babblers; of worthy men, &amp; not of wordly men. And kings, to whom pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly this Office of Election doth belong, muſt put the more force, &amp; inſiſt the more in this prayer begging that which the wiſeſt of Kings, <hi>Salomon</hi> petitioned of God, <hi>Da mihi ſedium tuarum aſſiſtricem ſapientiam, vt mecum fit,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Wiſed. 9.10.</note> 
                  <hi>&amp; mecum la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boret, vt ſciam quid ſit acceptum coram te omni tempore: O God of my fathers, ſend me wiſedome out of thy holy heauens, and from the Throne of thy Glory, that being preſent, ſhee may labour with me, that I may know what is pleaſant vnto thee, &amp;c.</hi> This wiſe and diſcreete king, was not contented with that guide and light which humane wiſedome might afford him, but had recourſe by prayer to that diuine Light and Wiſedome, which is that that guideth Kings without ſtumbling, or feare of falling into errour. For as <hi>Wiſdome</hi> ſaith of her ſelfe; <hi>Per me reges regnant, &amp;c:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Prou. 8.15.</note> 
                  <hi>By me Kings reigne, and Princes decree Iuſtice.</hi> As if ſhee ſhould haue ſayd: By the hand and Light, which I reach forth vnto Kings, they goe rightly on in their iudgements, and their Elections, ſo that they reigne, and conſerue themſelues in quiet poſſeſſion of their Kingdomes. The drift of my diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe is this; That when a King ſhall come to elect and make choiſe of his <hi>Miniſters,</hi> his firſt care muſt be, to pray heartily vnto God, that hee will direct this his choiſe and election. And ſo much the more diligence hee ought to vſe therein, by how much of more importance and of greater qualitie the Miniſter ſhall be, that is to be imployed.</p>
               <p>After Prayer, which is diuine, other humane diligences,
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:180809:46"/>
are to bee followed. Whereof the chiefeſt is, that the Prince informe himſelfe of the good ſufficiency, the honeſt life, and faire carriage of thoſe, whom hee is to chooſe. And that heerein, he may not be deceiued, it is neceſſary, that with Chriſt he goe vp vnto the Mount; That is, To ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uate his Conſideration vnto God and to auoide vulgar opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions; To ſtrip himſelfe of paſſion, and not to ſtrike hands with thoſe, that are not Gods friends; To forget all kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, and Alliance; Not to take in the infectious Ayre of fond affection; Not to apply himſelfe to that, which the importunat interceſſions and requeſts of a fauourite, or kinſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man ſhall ſeeke to draw from him for their priuate benefit; Nor to hearken to the negotiation of cunning and ſubtile pretenders, but onely to the good of the Common-wealth, and the quicke diſpatch of buſineſſes, and other the like of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices, that are to be exerciſed by men of their place. And albeit, it was my purpoſe, not to ſerue my ſelfe, in this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, but with the Teſtimonies and Examples of holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and the Doctors that are Expoſitors thereupon; Yet can I not omit to exemplifie heere in one, of King <hi>Don Philip,</hi> the ſecond of this name, whoſe ſoule doth reſt in peace, being that for his great prudence, and zeale to Iuſtice, and for his good gouernement, all the Kings of the world may acknowledge him their Maſter. The caſe is this; A Preſident of his time, hauing propoſed a Perſon for a place, relating vnto him the qualities, which concurred in him, for the meriting thereof, hee farther added; That the Lady <hi>Infanta,</hi> did much deſire this prouiſion ſhould bee made him. Heereunto his Maieſtie with a great deale of iudgement, and grauitie, made anſwer. <hi>Y mi hija que ſabe deſſo?</hi> What? Has my Daughter a hand in this? Can ſhe iudge of his worth. Giuing his Preſident by this his Anſwer to vnderſtand, that he ſhould not haue alleaged vnto him that, for to make a good election, which ſhould paſſe the bounds of the conſideration of thoſe parts and qualities,
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:180809:46"/>
wherewith hee was to be furniſhed, were his pretenſion neuer ſo much fauoured by the mediation and interceſſion of great perſons. And heereunto I farther adde, that a king ſhould in no hand content himſelfe with the bare know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of thoſe onely, whom he knowes by fight, and walke dayly vp and downe in his Court, but that hee ſhould take leyſure to informe himſelfe of as many as hee can, and to follow the ancient cuſtome, in giuing order to his Generalls, Vice-kings, Prelates, and Gouernours of euery Prouince, to giue him information of the beſt and ſufficientſt ſubiects that are in their Gouernment, and that after due conſultation had with them, they ſhould nominate three or foure vnto him, that from amongſt many good, hee might chooſe the beſt. And the reſt to bee liſted, and taken notice of, that vpon occaſion they might receiue imployment. From whence likewiſe this good will ariſe, that All, in all partes, great, and ſmall, will ſtudy the Science and Arte of good gouernment, fly Vice, and follow Vertue, that they may in their due time be numbered amongſt the Choſen. Let a King goe, <hi>Con ſu ſpaſſos contados</hi> (as they ſay) with a ſlow foote, in thoſe Elections, which he is to make, giuing way vnto Time, and to information. Which hee ought wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly to heare, neither in all giuing credit to all; nor being (as many are) too incredulous. Let him remit things to Tryall and Examination, it being a thing needefull for him ſo to doe. For, if it be not wiſedome, to lend a facile eare to all that we heare, for, the wiſe man ſaith: <hi>Qui citò credit, leuis eſt corde;</hi> So likewiſe doth it betoken little prudence, to liue alwaies ſuſpicious and diſtruſtfull. Something muſt be left to Experience. But to come to the qualifying of perſons, if the one's qualities be of ten, the other of nine quilates, and all of them neceſſarie for the Office of a Counſellour, the firſt ought to be preferred, though the other out ſtrip him in Eſtate, in fauour, in riches, and great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe. For, in that Miniſtry, there ought reſpect to be had
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:180809:47"/>
onely to the aduantages of ſufficiencie, and not of power. Nor ſeruices, albeit two be equall in ſufficiencie, muſt looſe their place, and right. But that hee, who hath done the greater ſeruices for his King and Countrie, ought to bee preferred before the other. Now there is this difference (amongſt many others) betwixt a good Prince, and him that is not ſo; that a good Prince, conferrs his Offices, according to the ſufficiencie and vertue of the Miniſter he maketh choiſe of; the other vpon fauour, and humane re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects, vſing therein his power, but not attending diſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butiue Iuſtice, which rewardeth euery one according to his deſerts, without reſpect either vnto perſons, or particular intents.</p>

                  <hi>Vltra vires tuas eſt negotium, ſolus illud non poteris ſuſtinere. This thing is too heauy for thee; Thou
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:180809:47"/>
art not able to performe it thy ſelfe alone. Cadendo cades</hi> (ſaith another Letter) <hi>By falling, thou ſhalt fall, and all this people, that is with thee. Daras de ojos</hi> (as they ſay) <hi>à cada paſſo.</hi> Thou muſt looke well about thee. And ioyntly with this, hee propounded the qualities, which hee ought to conſider in thoſe, whom hee was to chooſe for that Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtrie. <hi>Proinde ex omni plebe, viros ſapientes &amp; timentes deum, in quibus ſit veritas.</hi> Or as another letter hath it;<note place="margin">Exod. 18.21.</note> 
                  <hi>Viros veridicos, &amp; qui oderint avaritiam: Thou ſhalt prouide out of all the people able men, ſuch as feare God; men of truth, hating Couetouſneſſe, &amp;c.</hi> Now, let vs goe pondering euery word in particuler, and in them, the qualities of Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters. The firſt is <hi>Prouide;</hi> Which ſignifieth not onely to prouide, but to fore-ſee, and conſider. For, the election of a Miniſter is a buſineſſe of great prouidence, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration, and the moſt important and neceſſarie for a King in matter of gouernment. On the good, or bad Electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Counſellours, dependeth the whole honour and profit both of King, and Kingdome. And he that erres in this, muſt neceſſarily erre in all. For the ſpring of a fountaine being ſpoyled, all the water is ſpoiled. And a King failing in this Principle, all goes to deſtruction. For without doubt, all good diſpatch growes from the force and vertue of good Counſaile. Then therefore is a King held to be wiſe and prudent, when he hath wiſe and pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent Counſailours: Hee ſucceedeth well with all his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions, and inioyeth fame, credit, and reputation both with his ſubiects, and with ſtrangers. Of the one he is beloued and obayed, and of the other dreaded and feared; and of all eſteemed and commended: The whole king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome reſteth contented and ſatisfied. And though in ſomething hee ſometime erre, none will beleeue it. But when Priuie-Counſailours are no ſuch manner of men, all murmur, and proclaime to the world; That there is not an able man in all the Counſell, and if in ſome one thing or
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:180809:48"/>
other hee hap to haue good ſucceſſe, few or none will giue credit thereunto, but rather conceiue, it was done by Chance.</p>
               <p>The ſacred Text ſays farther; <hi>De omni plebe:</hi> Out of all the People. As if he ſhould haue ſaid out of all the 12. Tribes, or families of this people; thereby to giue vs to vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand; That for to make a good Election, it is requiſit, that there ſhould not remaine a nooke, or corner in all his king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes, where diligence ſhould not be vſed (as before hath beene ſayd) to ſearch out the fitteſt Miniſters. And likewiſe it may in this word, be giuen vs to vnderſtand, that in matter of Election, wee are not to haue reſpect to Linage, Kindred, or Parentage, but to vertue, ſufficiencie, and courage, accompained with other good qualities, which adapt a man to be a Counſellour. And therefore it is ſaid anon after, <hi>Viros ſapientes,</hi> Wiſemen; men of vnderſtanding heads, and ſtout hearts, which dare boldly and plainely to ſpeake the truth, and to maintaine and put it in execution, when they ſee fit time: for your puſillanimous and white-liuerd perſons are not fit Miniſters for a State. <hi>Noli quaerere fieri iudex, niſi valeas virtute irrumpere iniquitates.</hi> He that hath not a face, to out-face a Lye, and to defend the truth, let him neuer take vpon him the Office of a Miniſter of Iuſtice. In the booke of <hi>Daniel</hi> it is ſtoryed, that King <hi>Nabucodonozor</hi> was reſolued to haue done ſome cruell chaſtiſement vpon his Princes, and Counſellours, for that hauing asked them the Interpretation of a troubleſome dreame hee had, none of them could declare the meaning of it. And howbeit they told him, that they could not tell what to make of it, &amp; plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly confeſſed the truth, yet notwithſtanding the King con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued, that hee had good reaſon to except againſt them. For (thought hee) if you know it, and for feare will not tell it me, yee are Cowards; And if you know it not, yee are ignorant; and either of theſe is a great fault in Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſailours, &amp; afford ſufficient cauſe, why ye ſhould be puniſhed; in that yee would offer to take that Office vpon yee; which
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:180809:48"/>
firſt of all hath neede of ſtoutneſſe of courage; and ſecond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, to be learned and expert in ſo many and various things, as a King hath occaſion to vſe yee in. And therefore that wiſe <hi>Iethro,</hi> after the word <hi>Viros,</hi> Men, puts, <hi>ſapientes,</hi> Wiſe Or as the 70. and others tranſlate it, <hi>potentes fortes.</hi> Becauſe in Miniſters and Counſellours of State, ſtrength, courage, conſtancie, and wiſedome, ſhould walke hand in hand. The Courts and Pallaces of Kings and Princes, that which they are leaſt ſtored with all, is Truth. They ſcarce know her face, nay not ſo much as of what colour or complexion ſhee is, the onley Minions there made of, being flatteries, and lyes. A wiſe and ſtout man, is daunted with nothing, is neuer troubled, nor altered, he ſtands vpon his own worth and ſinceritie, &amp; is Lord and Maſter of his reaſon, he ſpeakes with libertie and freedome, hee repreſents the truth to his King, and maintaines it, <hi>Pie quedo</hi> (as they ſay) ſtiffely and ſtoutly, without reſpect to any thing, no not ſo much as his owne proper life, hee ouerthrowes plots, diſcouers the impoſtures, deceits and Lyes of flatterers; for the which he had neede of courage and wiſedome.</p>
               <p>Now let vs ſee, what that wiſedome is, which a King is to require in his Miniſters. Not worldly wiſedome, wherof <hi>S. Bernard</hi> ſaith, That thoſe which inioy it, boaſting them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues thereof, very wiſely goe to Hell. The queſtion that I aske is; Whether, they ſhould be Philoſophers, Diuines, or Lawyers, or in what kinde of faculties, they ſhould be wiſe? Heereunto firſt I anſwer; that queſtionleſſe, it would be a great helpe to the making of a good Counſellour to bee ſeene in theſe Sciences, and to haue ſpent ſome time of ſtudy in them. But in caſe they haue no skill in theſe it ſhall ſuffice, that they are wiſe in that which belongeth vnto that Miniſtry, for which they are nominated and called; to wit: To be a Counſailour, which is a perſon, that is fit, ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient, and able, for that charge which he is to adminiſter. That hee haue a nimble wit, and quicke apprehenſion, for
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:180809:49"/>
without that, the reſt ſerues to little purpoſe. Whereas he that is furniſhed therewith, with a little helpe, attaineth to much; He knowes things paſt, vnderſtands the preſent, and giues his iudgement of things to come. That hee be well read in ancient and moderne Hiſtories, wherein are contained the ſentences and opinions of wiſe men of elder times, by which they ordred their Common-wealths, and maintained them in Peace. For this kinde of reading, doth indoctrinate more in a day, then Experience hath taught others in many yeares, which muſt by no meanes be wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting in a Counſellour for that ordinarily in them, are found Prudence, Authoritie, and Experience: That he haue happy memorie, which is the <hi>Archiue</hi> of the Sciences and Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of Truths; for without it, to reade and ſtudie, is (as they ſay) <hi>Coger aequa en vn harnero,</hi> to gather water in a ſiue; and it importeth much, in regard of the diuerſitie of buſineſſes, and perſons, with whom hee is to treate. That hee haue trauailed, and ſcene forraine Countries. That hee be skill'd in the Languages, and haue in all of them the Arte and garbe of ſpeaking and diſcourſing well. That he more eſteeme the ſeruice of his King, and the publicke good, then his own priuate gaine. That hee be courteous, humble, affable, and yet of a good ſpirit. That hee lend an attentiue care, and that hee keepe that gate open for great and ſmall, rich, and poore. But aboue all theſe, he muſt be of approued vertue, for without it, all the reſt are of no eſteeme. Hee that ſhall haue more, or leſſe of theſe quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, which are for all in Common, ſhall bee the more, or leſſe ſufficient Counſellour. As for Vice-royes, Gouernours, Ambaſſadors and other great Gouernments of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, ſuch are to be choſen, who together with the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid qualities haue ſtudied, and ſpent ſome yeares in the Schoole of experience, and hauing beene conuerſant at the Kings elbow, and in his Courte, and Counſailes, not only for the greatneſſe of thoſe mindes, and ſtomacks which are
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:180809:49"/>
bred there, (a neceſſary qualitie for to occupie great places, and not to bee bred vp with a poore portion of Treating, and Vnderſtanding, which begets mindes according to the ſame meaſure) but likewiſe, becauſe there by their Treating with Kings, Princes, and other great perſons aſſiſting them in their Counſells and graue conſultations, communicating with great Miniſters, and Counſellours of State, diuerſe caſes and buſineſſes, the Practick of all affaires, is thereby the more, and better apprehended; As your practitio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners in Phyſicke by conferring with great Phyſitians. He therefore, that ſhall haue both Learning, and Experience, ſhall amongſt all men be the moſt remarkable. But, <hi>Quis eſt hic, &amp; laudabimus eum:</hi> Shew mee this Man, and we will commend him. For Mans life is ſhort, the Arte long, and experience hard to be atchieued. But to ſumme vp this diſcourſe, and giue an ende thereunto, I ſay: That he that is to bee made a Counſellour of Warre, ſhould there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in haue beene exerciſed many yeares. And that he, that is of the Councell of State, ſhould haue a full knowledge of all, and ſhould be very dextrous in matters of gouernment, both publike, and particular, and well verſt in military diſcipline, becauſe hee is to conſult both of warre, and peace. Which becauſe they are things ſo oppoſite, and contrary, a man cannot iudge well in the one vnleſſe he know and vnderſtand aright the other. As wee ſhall ſhew heereafter when we ſhall more in particular treate of this Counſell.</p>
               <p>Other qualities, are competible more in eſpeciall to Iudges Iuſtices, and Preſidents, to whom that particularly apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taineth, which is deliuered in that word, <hi>Sapientes;</hi> That they well vnderſtand the facultie of the Lawes, and that correſponding with their name, they be <hi>Iuris-prudentes,</hi> well ſeene in all matters, carrying an euen hand towards all, and adminiſtring Iuſtice without partialitie:<note place="margin">Deut. 16.18.19.</note>

For theſe three things, Iudgement, Learning, and Truth, are much about one, and in them conſiſteth the whole perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of a Miniſter; <hi>In quibus ſit Veritas.</hi> For in the breſt of a good Iudge, there muſt neither raigne paſſion, nor affection, but the pure Truth, which hee cannot poſſibly avoyd, vnleſſe hee will wrong nature it ſelfe. For our ſoule is naturally inclined to Truth. And it is ſo proper to a wiſe and prudent Man, that hee that doth not ſay it, vnſaies himſelfe. And certaine it is, that the gouernment of a Kingdome, is ſo much the more good or ill, by how much the truth therein, hath more, or leſſe place. For if buſineſſes be not ſeaſoned therewith, as meates are with ſalt, neither the poore ſhall be defended from the oppreſſion of the rich, nor the rich poſſeſſe their goods in ſafety; men and
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:180809:50"/>
womens honors ſhall runne danger, and no one perſon can promiſe to himſelfe ſecuritie. And therefore it is ſo much the more needfull, that a iudge ſhould treate Truth, and deſire that all ſhould doe the like; by how much the more are they that abhorre it, and ſeeke to conceale it; an olde diſeaſe, which was almoſt borne with vs into the world. And if Iudges ſhall not fauour Truth, and plaine dealing; treachery, and Lying will reigne and beare rule. Let Kings take heede how they chooſe men that are feare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and timerous to be their Miniſters, who out of cowar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dize and puſillanimitie, hide the Truth, and dare not bring her forth to Light. For, as ſhee is the foundation of Iuſtice, and Chriſtian iudgement, if a Iudge ſhall not loue it with his heart, tracke the ſteps of it, and draw it out of that darke dungeon wherein ſhee lyes, Iuſtice will be in danger of being cruſh't, and falſhood will preuaile. As in that peruerſe Iudgement in Chriſtes cauſe, where the Iudge was ſo farre from being deſirous to know the truth, that hee did not know what kinde of thing it was; And therefore demanded in the face of the open Court; <hi>Quid eſt Veritas?</hi> What is Truth? To whom, that diuine wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome made no anſwer, perceiuing him to be ſuch a foole, as to be ignorant of the firſt vndoubted Principle of Iuſtice; and ſuffring himſelfe to be carryed away with falſe accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſations, and feigned relations, which had no bulke nor body in them, no ſubſtance in the world, nor any ſhew, ſaue of a poore ſhadow, to be thus miſ-led.</p>

                  <hi>Librorum numero circumſtante.</hi> The Preſident before ſpecified, had a great many of bookes about him; To ſhew how much it importeth, that Iudges, and Preſidents bee Learned, and well read in the bookes of their facultie. <hi>Epiphanius</hi> ſaith; That hee ſaw a Statua of Truth, which in it's forehead had two letters, the firſt, and the laſt, of the Greeke <hi>Alphabet;</hi> in it's mouth other two; and other two in it's breſt; and ſo through all the parts of it's body to it's
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:180809:51"/>
very feete. So that this was all enamelled with Letters, as the other was rounded with bookes. Thereby, giuing vs to vnderſtand that that Man, which is truly the man he ought to be, and is to aduiſe and gouerne others, his head, hands, and feete, muſt be ſtucke full of Letters. He muſt be learned from the ſole of the foote, to the Crowne of the head, full of Letters hee muſt bee; for in the diſcour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of the Vnderſtanding, in the working of the hands, and in the moouing of the feete, wee may eaſily gueſſe, whether a man be wiſe, or no; Whether he hath ſtudied, or doth ſtudie; For though a man be neuer ſo wiſe, neuer ſo learned, hee ſtill forgetteth ſomewhat. So that, it is not enough for him to haue ſtudyed, but it is requiſit, that he ſtill continue his ſtudy, that hee may repayre with that which he learneth, the loſſe of that which hee forgetteth. As in a naturall body, that, by dayly eating and drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is reſtored, which is by our naturall heate conſumed. <hi>Et oculis eſſet ſubclauſis.</hi> His eyes (which are the win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowes by which Paſſion enters vnto the ſoule) were ſhut. Becauſe hee ſhould not be led away with the reſpect to thoſe about him. For, hee muſt not haue an eye and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to the Eſtate and condition of perſons, to doe more fauour (when it comes to point of Iuſtice) to one, then another. And for this reaſon, the ſayd Aegyptians, did ordinarily paint Iuſtice, without a Head. The Head, is the common ſeate of all the Sences; ſignifying thereby, that by no one ſence, a Iudge ſhould open a doore to Paſſion, but that he ſhould place them all in heauen with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out reſpect to any thing vpon earth. And this, is not to reſpect perſons, but Iuſtice.</p>

To intimate that

they ſhould alwaies ſtand in the preſence of the Lord, from whence is to come that Light, which is to cleare the eyes of their intentions, avoyding to caſt them downe towards the ground, that the Vapour of humane reſpects which is rayſed from thence, may not cloude and darken the ſight of their vnderſtanding. They muſt be olde, and wiſe, becauſe they are to iudge with mature Counſaile, which accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panyeth that age. And as it is ordred by their Lawes, they muſt haue neither eyes, to ſee, nor hands, to receiue bribes. And if they would cut off their wiues hands too, the cauſe would be the better iuſtified. For in them, your bribes finde an open gate, and are ſo eaſie to be knowne in this kind of trading, that there are few or none, but take notice of it. They haue the ſlight of hand, and (like Gypſies) haue a fine facilitie in deceiuing, and not hard to be wrought vpon to gaine by this vngodly courſe. And looke what buſineſſe they labour to effect, they are vſually the leaſt iuſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able; And if they are diſpoſed to fauour this man, or that cauſe, and will but ſet their friends, and wits roundly to worke, and doe their beſt, they will ſhrewdly put a Iudge to his ſhiftes, and driue him to that ſtreight, that Iuſtice ſhall hardly eſcape a fall. I would haue iudges therefore with their hands off, and their eyes out, leaſt that befall them, which did a couple of their place, and qualitie, who came to ſee the Proceſſe of a famous, but falſe, and looſe woman, who perceiuing that the reaſons of the Relator did worke little vpon them, appealed, <hi>para viſta de ojos,</hi> that ſhee might appeare face to face, and in her informati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, when ſhee came <hi>Ore tenus,</hi> ſhee cunningly diſcouered her beautie, by a careleſſe letting fall of her mantle, and ſo bewitched them therewith, that allowing for good thoſe powerfull witneſſes of her eyes, and face, they releaſed her, and gaue her for free. But to ſay the truth, it was her looſeneſſe that freed her, and their lightneſſe, that condemned them; making that fault light, which before weighed heauie. And

how ſhal he freely adminiſter Iuſtice, who hath his heart cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiuated, and in the power of him, and her, that can turne and winde him, which way they liſt and wreſt him from good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe? More Iudges haue bin vndone by Lightneſſe, then by Cruelty. The one begetteth feare the other contempt. And by the way, let them take this leſſon a long with them, that not onely in reality of truth they conſerue their credit without ſpot, but likewiſe in apparance procure to giue ſuch good Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples that the world may not iuſtly charge them, no not with ſo much as a diſcompoſed looke, neither in the open ſtreete, nor Court of Iuſtice; for euery bend from their brow, or euery ſmile from their countenance, is the Common peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples <hi>Almanack,</hi> wher-by they make coniecture, whether it is like to be faire, or fowle weather; reading in the face fauour to one, and rigour to another. Wherefore, as their place is great, ſo is their perill; The way is ſlippery wherein they tread, and therfore had need looke well to their feete. Woe be vnto that Iudge, which ſeeth, and ſeeth not; ſees the beſt, and followes the worſt; ſuffering his reaſon to be ſubdued by paſſion, and himſelfe by one poore ſlender haire of a handſome woman, to be led by the noſe whether ſhee will leade him. For a good face, is a tacite kinde of recommendation, a faire ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription, and a ſilent deceit, which troubles the cleareneſſe of the minde, making white appeare to be blacke, and what is iuſt,<note place="margin">Exod. 23.8.

And for ſuch kinde of corrupt men he would vſually ſay, hee had euer a fingar in readines, to plucke out their eyes.

The Kings of Spaine haue likewiſe made ſome Lawes with very ſharpe and rigorous puniſhments, but all not worth a pinne, becauſe they are not executed. So that this bad cuſtome alone, is of more force, then all the lawes. Theſe are written with inke, on paper; Thoſe, with letters of gold on the heart. The Lawes threaten with roughneſſe and rigour; Money perſwades with ſoftneſſe and gentleneſſe, and carryes mens mindes after it without contradiction. The Lawes, haue few to defend them, &amp; to put them in execution. But this euill cuſtome, is of more force then the Law, &amp; hath ſtronger Abettors. In a word, terrible are the forces and skir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſhes of this foule aſſaulting vice, become now as it were na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall vnto vs, and more vſed in theſe, then any other Times whatſoeuer. <hi>Demoſthenes</hi> ask't the <hi>Athenians</hi> (&amp; thoſe which are, may aske of thoſe that haue bin) what were in thoſe times which are not in theſe? And himſelfe makes the anſwer, That one thing was now wanting vnto them; whereby thoſe that liu'd then, alwayes went away with the victory, &amp; maintai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:180809:57"/>
their libertie. Which was; The perpetuall hatred which they bore vnto thoſe, who ſuffered themſelues to be corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with mony. In ſtead whereof, it is now come to that paſſe, that to receiue a bribe, is onely a nine dayes wonder; if the ſame be confeſt, it is made a matter of laughter; if pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, he that receiues, receiues a pardon for it; and he that informes, ſent away with a flea in his eare, and in ſtead of a reward, receiues a round checke for his labour, &amp; growes a hated man, and troubleſome member in a Common-wealth. But vnfortunate is that Common-wealth, where Corruption liues vncontrolled. And becauſe this Vice goes daily taking deepe roote, and grows ſtill ſtronger and ſtron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, inuenting new impudencies, new ſlightes and ſubtilties, it is needefull that Kings ſhould hunt Counter, and finde out ſome new Tricke, to take theſe olde ones in the Trap. And this one (me thinks) would be a pretty remedy for this diſeaſe; That a Law were made, That of all thoſe, that ſhould be nominated for Miniſters and Officers pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like and particular in any Tribunall, or Miniſtry what ſoeuer as well of Iuſtice, and gouernment, as of the publike Treaſurie, there ſhould an Inuentorie be taken (by ſome de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted for that purpoſe) of all their rents, and goods moue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, and vnmoueable, and when they are to take their oath (as the faſhion is) at their entrance into their Office, the ſaid Inuentory ſhould be preſented in open Court, and there they made to ſweare, and take a ſolemne oath that this is a true Inuentorie, and that their Eſtate is thus and thus, neither more nor leſſe, or much there abouts, to the end that when their ſtates come to be increaſed, and their wealth makes a great noyſe in the world, it may (vpon better in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quirie) be knowen how, and which way, they came by it. For experience daily teacheth vs, that your Iudges, your Exchequer men, and other publike Officers, enter into the Office with little, and goe out with much. And I would, that the Kings Atturney generall, or one of like nature,
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:180809:58"/>

And this is no new doctrine, but ſhall finde it (if we looke backe to former times) practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed long a goe. And the Emperour <hi>Antoninus Pius,</hi> did likewiſe ordaine, that all Liuetenants, and Gouerners be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they went to ſerue in their Reſidencies and Offices, they ſhould bring in an Inuentorie of all they had, that when the time of their Gouernment was expired, by coating and comparing the one with the other, they might ſee how and in what manner they thriued thereupon. <hi>Audiſtis</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>Praefectum Praetorij noſtri antè Triduum quàm fieret, mendicum, &amp; pauperem: ſed ſubitò diuitem factum.

Setting at nought the Lawes,

For he that only gets by lawfull meanes can hardly liue at ſo high a rate, as ſome of his fellowes doe, build ſuch ſumptuous and coſtly houſes, and leaue ſo faire and great an eſtate behind him to his Heyre. And he, who heerein does more then he can, will likewiſe do more then he ought. For he, that will ſeeke to out-doe his meanes, will not ſticke to out-doe his honeſtie.

               <p>All this (ſay they) that you ſay, is true. We confeſſe as much. But withall we muſt tell you, That that which we receiue is <hi>ſubſidium gratuitum,</hi> a free gift, a meere gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuitie, with a great deale of loue, and good liking of the Giuer. And we affirme, That all (for the moſt part) that is giuen, is reſpectiue, and is in that Predicament, which the <hi>Logicians</hi> tearme, <hi>Ad aliquid.</hi> Whereby he that receiueth a courteſie, is bound to returne a courteſie. And thoſe which giue, hope to receiue from ſuch Miniſters, that which they cannot iuſtly giue them. With theſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions, a gift is lawfull, and eſteemed to be lawfully re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued, when it comes free, vnclogg'd, diſintereſſed, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out pretenſion, and without reſpect of requitall, or reference to any recompence or retribution. That is a gift, which goes diſ-roabed of all reſpects which is neither a friend nor kindſman, nor kindſwoman of the party that giues it, and hath no obligation, no Intereſt, no neceſſitie, but is all pure loue, and is freely giuen of grace, onely to do him good, that receiues it, The reſt is Vſurie, Loane, bribery, and hope of gaine. And if they will ſee that this is true, let them come downe from that high place wherein they are, let a Viſitation goe forth againſt them, and they ſhall quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſee, how euery man longs and deſires, that that may bee returned to the Owners, which they haue got by foule play. It is a great blindeneſſe in Miniſters, to imagine, that what is giuen them, proceedes from liberalitie, and out of the good will and loue they beare vnto them. God he knowes, it is no ſuch matter, but what they do in this kinde, is only to corrupt them, and to oblige them to do that, which they neither may, nor ought. Let them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue me, and not deceiue themſelues. For to giue, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue, is a cunning peece of buſineſſe, a thing of great ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifice, wit, and ſubtiltie, and on whatſoeuer occaſion it
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:180809:59"/>
worketh, it workes Miracles. But in caſe gifts ſhould not corrupt, at leaſt they appeaſe, and moue affection. Being (as that wiſe King <hi>Salomon</hi> ſaith) like vnto the waues of the Sea, which make the talleſt ſhip to reele, be ſhe neuer ſo well ballaſted. And waues neuer come ſingle. And, if they be ſtrong waues indeede, they ouerturne her, and ſinke her in the Sea. <hi>Reprom ſsio nequiſsima multos perdidit,</hi>

And let them not truſt to their taking in ſecret, nor of ſuch, and ſuch a perſon; for the Diuine Sunne of Iuſtice, whom they offend, will diſcouer and bring all to light. And though no body ſhould ſee or know it, it is enough that God, and his own Conſcience knowes it, which are two ſure Witneſſes, beſides many other, which time will pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce.</p>
               <p>They likewiſe alleage, That they haue leaue and licence of their Kings to receiue gifts. Whereunto, firſt of all I anſwer; that it is not to be beleeued, that Chriſtian Kings will grant ſuch Licences as theſe, which are ſo pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iudic all, pernicious, ſcandalous, and ſo contrary to the Common good, and good gouernment of their King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes. Secondly I ſay; (ſpeaking with that reuerence and reſpect, which is due vnto the authoritie of Kings) that it cannot be grounded on good Diuinitie, that they may giue any ſuch leaue or licence vnto their Miniſters. Againe, they vrge, that ſometimes, in ſome particular caſe, gifts haue beene giuen to ſome great <hi>Priuado,</hi> or fauourite of the King. It may be ſo; But ſure I am, that to no Counſellour of Iuſtice, can it euer iuſtly be, or may be done. But becauſe this will fall within the compaſſe of our inſuing diſcourſe; I will cite thoſe words; <hi>Timentes

               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">O</seg>Ne of the greateſt miſchiefes incident vnto Kingdomes is; That Kings haue not true notice giuen them of worthy perſons, for to imploy them in his ſeruice. A great cauſe whereof is, that your vndeſeruing, or (at leaſt) leſſe ſufficient, are clapt in betwixt them, and home; Thoſe are the men, that are moſt intermitted, take moſt vpon them, and procure by their Negociating and Plotting, to occupie the beſt places, and not contenting themſelues therewith, ſeeke to ſhut the doore againſt men of merit, and to keepe them out, to the end that their owne defects, by this courſe, may receiue the leſſe diſcouery.<note place="margin">Contraria juxta ſep<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ſita, magis eluceſcunt.</note> For this is the nature of things oppoſite each to other, that the neerer they are one to the other, the more excellent lays it's Contraryes defect, the more open. Now to occurre to this miſchiefe, wiſe <hi>Iethro</hi> aduiſed his ſonne in Law, that he ſhould ſeeke out men of good parts, and chooſe them (as we ſayd before) from amongſt all the people. And we ſhall better perceiue, what that Counſaile comprehendeth, if we will but conſider that other place of <hi>Deuteronomy;</hi> Where <hi>Moſes</hi> diſcourſing with the people, what diligence he had vſed on his part, it is there mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, that he ſpake vnto them, and admoniſhed them (to the end that the Election of the Miniſters might take the better) that they themſelues likewiſe would vſe their di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligences, and then giue him notice of thoſe perſons, which
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:180809:61"/>
they held in greateſt eſteeme amongſt them, and were (in the generall opinion) the ableſt men. <hi>Date ex vobis viros ſapientes, &amp; gnaros, &amp; quorum Conuerſatio ſit probata in Tribubus veſtris, vt ponam eos vobis Principes: Take yee wiſe men and vnderſtanding,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Deut. 1.13.</note> 
                  <hi>and knowen amongſt your Tribes, and I will make them Rulers ouer you.</hi> And indeed, the beſt and ſureſt courſe, that Kings can take, to come to that notice or knowledge they deſire, is to lay holde on thoſe perſons, whoſe approbation is ſo notorious, that all the people giue good Teſtimonie of them. For, (as a wiſe man hath well obſerued) the generall opinion, is that Touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone, which proueth or reproueth. For, it cannot be, that One ſhould deceiue All. And happily from hence grew that Common Adage <hi>Vox populi, vox Dei:</hi> The Peoples voyce, is Gods voyce. We muſt giue Credit to the fame and report that goes of Men. For (as <hi>Tacitus</hi> ſaith) ſhe ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times makes the choyſe of Miniſters; it being his meaning, that this ſatisfaction ſhould be giuen to the people, that thoſe, that are to gouerne them, ſhould be choſen and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected by that common fame, and good report, that goes of them. And heere by the way let me tell you, that it is not much amiſſe, that ſome Offices, and Preferments be in a diſſembled kinde of diſguiſe, purpoſely publiſhed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they be beſtowed, to ſee how it will be intertained and receiued by the people; to whom it is fit ſome ſatisfaction ſhould be giuen, as being the body that is to be comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded. This is a Trick of State, whereof (vpon ſome occaſions) <hi>Fernando,</hi> ſurnamed the Wiſe, made good Vſe. For when he was to goe any great Voiage, vndertake any Warre, or at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt ſome new Enterpriſe, or any other action of impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, he would not publiſh, nor iuſtifie the ſame to the world, till he had vſed ſome art and cunning, imploying ſome perſons fit for that purpoſe (before his deſignes were throughly vnderſtood) to giue it out; That the King ſhould do well to make ſuch, or ſuch a warre, to make this or
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:180809:62"/>
that prouiſion, for this, or that reaſon. So that firſt of all, the vulgar were made acquainted therewith and reſted ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied with the reaſons that were rendred for it. And then afterwards it comming to be publiſhed, that the King had done, or would doe ſuch a thing, it is incredible to beleeue, with how much ioy, loue, and applauſe of the people, and whole Kingdome, this his Reſolution was receiued. But miſtake me not I pray; I do not ſay, that this is to be done alwayes, but on ſome occaſions, or great preparations. And Kings in this caſe, muſt haue a care, that they haue faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Centinells, that may truly certifie them, how that Newes takes, and what exception (if any ariſe) they make againſt it, and vpon what grounds, that if any thing had beene omitted, it might be amended A Preſident (not vnlike to this) had the <hi>Roman</hi> Common-wealth in thoſe it's firſt flouriſhing dayes. Which did cauſe their Lawes to be ſet vp in pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like for 27. dayes together before they ſhould be of force, to the end, that the people might peruſe them, and thinke well vpon them. How much more ought this Courſe to be taken in <hi>Legibus viuentibus:</hi> in thoſe liuing Lawes which are your greater and principaller ſort of Miniſters, and ſuch as are to command and gouerne a Common-wealth who ought to be well beloued, and well receiued of the people, that they may loue them, reſpect them, and beleeue them, in all they ſhall ſay, as they would their own fathers?</p>
               <p>I well perceiue, that there may be much deceit in the world, and that there are ſome men ſo ſubtile and ſo cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning that only with a pen in their hand, they make them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues Maſters of other mens ſtudies, and labours, and by this tricke gaine the credit and opinion of able and ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient men, when as indeed they are nothing leſſe. And this deceit takes more in matter of learning and wiſedome, which (as we ſaid before) cannot be meaſured out with the yard. And in no place is this ſo common, as in the Courts of Kings, where your purpurated perſons (ſaith
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:180809:62"/>
                  <hi>Seneca</hi>) meaning thoſe, that abound in riches, and other corporall ornaments, ſtand a loofe of from the Vulgar and yet vſe to be vulgar in their vnderſtanding, to the preiudice of the good and true eſteeme of things; and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt theſe kinde of men, thoſe eaſily get the name and fame of wiſe, who talke boldly, and ſpinne out a large diſcourſe of thoſe things, which they well vnderſtand not. And it is daily ſeene, that ſome of theſe ſuperficiall fellowes haue beene preferr'd to better places by theſe their falſe oſtentations, and feigned knowledge, then great Learned Clarkes, by ſhewing themſelues humble-minded, temperate in their talke, and moderate in their conuerſation, could euer attaine vnto. And if this did happen only in thoſe Sciences and faculties, which they call <hi>depone lucrando,</hi> which are ſtudied for to get temporall riches, it were to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerable, becauſe for this end, opinion is of more profit for them, then Truth. But the griefe of it is, that this paſſeth forward euen vnto thoſe, that are profeſſours of that Science, which, as it is in it ſelfe ſuperiour, ſo ought it to make thoſe, which profeſſe the ſame ſuperiour in minde and vnderſtanding, and make them much more to eſteeme the truth, and exiſtency of wiſedome and knowledge, then falſe opinion, falſly gained amongſt the leſſe wiſer ſort of men. Now, for the auoyding of theſe inconueniences, it importeth much, that a King do not rely too much vpon the opinions of the Vulgar, which in particular are vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and ill grounded, but when they ſhall heare it general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſpoken, that ſuch a one is an eminent man in this, or that other thing, and that he hath not his fellow in the kingdome for theſe and theſe abilities, let the Counſell be called, the Partie thus recommended, examined, and let the King take information from them, that are euery way as able as he, euen in that wherein he profeſſes him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe his crafts-maſter, whether they giue vp the ſame ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit of him, or no; So that the fame, and opinion of a
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:180809:63"/>
good Souldiers, of a good Captaine, and of a good Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernour, muſt be confirmed by the Teſtimonie of thoſe that are the beſt both Souldiers, Captaines, and Gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours. By this line, may you leuell, &amp; by this courſe ſecure the approbation of all other Offices. And in thoſe whoſe ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>encie may be ſeene, and meaſured out by the ſuruay of Offici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alls, there cannot be ſo much deceit therein; but in thoſe, who are to ſerue a King and State, with great ſtudies, and with the knowledge of diuers faculties, as are your grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter dignities, and Eccleſiaſticall functions, where (as we are taught by the Apoſtle S. <hi>Paul</hi>) there is neceſſarily re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired great learning, great integritie of life, and great pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence: and therefore had more neede of examination and triall. And I hold it for a great inconuenience, that the iudgement of things of ſo high a nature ſhould be remit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the relation of thoſe, who are not onely farre from being able to iudge, but ſcarce know how to ſpeake truly of them. By meanes whereof it is very vſuall with them, to ſuffer themſelues to be ouercome by deceit, and ouerſwai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with paſſion, holding thoſe for the beſt and worthieſt, and recommending them to the King for thoſe high Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſteries and Offices, to whom, either they, or their friends, and kinſe-folke, beare moſt affection, or are moſt beholding. But opinion ought not to carry theſe things, vnleſſe it be confirmed with very good, and ſure Teſtimonies.</p>
               <p>Much of this miſchiefe will be remedied, if for theſe and ſuch like great Dignities and Offices, we ſhould not rely only vpon Fame, or that voice and report, which comes a far off, and ſomtimes painted ouer with apparencies, and in the maske and diſguiſe of truth, being nothing elſe, ſaue meere paſſion, but that we ſhould looke a little neerer into the inſide of theſe perſons, and grow by communication in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a fuller knowledge of them. Not that knowledge, which ſome Miniſters ſpeake of, who are ſayd to know only thoſe whom they preferre, or are willing to preferre, and only
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:180809:63"/>
for that they haue heard them talke in ordinary matters of complement, and baſe flatteries, which they vſe more, which haue all their wiſedome in their lips, then thoſe that are truly graue and learned men. Mens witts, are not like the water of a fountaine, which, at the firſt draught, our palate findes to be thicke, or thin, ſalt, or ſweete. It is like a Sea, without a bottome; or like vnto a deepe riuer, to know whoſe depth, we muſt wade through it from ſide to ſide. <hi>Sicut aqua profunda, Sic conſilium in corde viri,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Prou. 20.5.</note> (ſaith the holy Ghoſt) <hi>Counſaile in the heart of a man, is like a deepe water: Sed homo ſapiens exhauriet illud:</hi> But a man of vnderſtanding will draw it out. And it is the learned, and wiſe, that muſt make iudgement of wiſe, and learned men. In the ſacred hiſtory of <hi>Geneſis,</hi> we reade, that when the holy Patriarke <hi>Iſaac</hi> determined to giue the benediction of the primogenitureſhip to his elder ſonne <hi>Eſau, Iacob</hi> came athwart him, and feigned himſelfe to be <hi>Eſau,</hi> (whom his aged father meant to bleſſe) and in a diſtinct and cleare voyce ſayd vnto him; I am thy firſt begotten ſonne <hi>Eſau;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Gen. 27.21.</note> To whom the Patriarke made anſwer; <hi>Thy voyce ſeemeth not to be the voyce of</hi> Eſau, <hi>but of Iacob.</hi> And therefore, <hi>Accede huc, vt tangam te fili mi: Come neere I pray thee that I may feele thee (my ſonne) whether thou be my very ſonne</hi> Eſau, <hi>or not?</hi> Many there are, who boaſt themſelues to be elder brothers in vertue, and learning, and with tricks and deuices, clad themſelues (to ſhew) in ſheepes cloathing, but inwardly are rauening Wolues, and with gifts and preſents, (as <hi>Iacob</hi> heere did) incline, or peruert the mindes of Miniſters, that they giue them credit, and beleife, ſtealing by this meanes the bleſſing away, and get<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting prioritie of place, being indeed younger brothers in their deſerts. And we are to conſider that in this Hiſtory, there did concurre two things, which were ſufficient to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue the Patriarke. The firſt, that he was blinde or at leaſt very dimme-ſighted; For (as wee ſaid before) when this
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:180809:64"/>
propounding or nominating of ſuch perſons, is left to the will of thoſe, that are blinde, or ignorant in theſe matters, there is not any thing done therein, which is not full of deceit. The ſecond, That the voyce was far different, from the perſon whom he felt. The like vſually happeneth in that matter which we haue now in hand. For there ſhall goe a voyce, and fame, and a true opinion of ſuch a man, that he hath very worthy parts, but comming vpon the firſt ſight to thoſe Miniſters, which are to preferre him, he ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth to be another manner of man, from that which hee truly is. And the reaſon of it is, for that (like the blinde) they only feele, touch, and examine theſe wiſe men, when as indeede they ſhould conforme themſelues to the ſettled voyce, and receiued opinion of the learned, who are better ſeene in theſe matters, and haue a deeper knowledge of them. Anciently, the people did meete all together, and with a generall and common voyce did nominate him to be their Biſhop whom they thought to be the fitteſt man, and moſt worthy the Epiſcopall Sea. And this was then held the faireſt and ſureſt Courſe. For (to ſpeake morally) it is not likely (as we ſaid before) that one ſingle man, ſhould deceiue ſo many, nor draw the votes and ſuffrages of all the whole multitude vnto him, vnleſſe he had parts and abilities deſeruing this their approbation. Many moſt holy men, and great Prelates, as <hi>Ambroſes, Gregories, Chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoſtomes,</hi> and other learned, and graue Diuines, haue recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued their preferments by ſuch Nominations as theſe. But this kinde of Election (now ſome yeares ſince) was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced (eſteeming it the fitteſt and the ſureſt way) to the voyces, and ſuffrages of your Deanes and Chapters of Cathedrall Churches. But, becauſe in humane things there is ſuch little ſtabilitie and firmeneſſe, your popular diſſenſions inforced them (for the greater eaſe and quiet of the Common-wealth) that your Kings (by conceſſion of the chiefe Biſhops) ſhould haue the nominating of them.
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:180809:64"/>
And no doubt, but it was well ordained by them, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard, that as thoſe their Royall perſons, are of ſo ſuperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our a degree, and ſo free from reſpects of humane buſineſſes (for theſe are wont to worke vpon the mindes of parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular men) ſo the nomination, that paſſeth through their hands, is by much the more certaine. For, as they are Kings and Rulers ouer the people, God doth inlighten them (ſo as they do not diſ-deſerue this light, or be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellious vnto him, for the making of a good and iudici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous choiſe.) <hi>Diuinatio in labijs regis,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Prou. 16.10.</note> 
                  <hi>in iudicio non errabit os ejus: A diuine ſentence is in the lips of the King, and his mouth ſhall not erre in iudgement.</hi> For, if he be a good and vertuous King, God doth aſſuredly aſſiſt his Actions, directing him by an eſpeciall grace, and particular fauour, that he may not erre in a buſineſſe of ſo great impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance. And this doth oblige them to looke well what they do, and to take a great deale of care and good heed in the nomination of them. And let Kings take this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to their conſideration, that being ſuch, as they ought to be, they haue in ſome meaſure a kinde of propheti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call gift, that they may not (will they but ſtrip them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues of paſſion, and craue Gods holy aſſiſtance) erre in their iudgement. Oh, what a neceſſitie is there in them to liue well, ſince that from the innocencie of their life, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſeth ordinarily a hitting right in their Actions, true In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligence, and a good diſpatch in their Negociations.</p>

               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>N the Creation of the vaſte Vniuerſe, God ſhewed his great Omnipotencie, and his infinite wiſedome in the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of thoſe things, which hee placed therein, with ſuch a concor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance and harmonie, that <hi>Diuus Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas</hi> confeſſeth that it could not be mended, without ſome diſſonancie, and iarring. And he citeth the example of a well tuned Viall, wherein it is not poſſible to ſtraine a ſtring, but the conſonancie in all the reſt is quite marred. This was that which the Wiſe man ſaid; That with weight, number, and meaſure, God had created, and ordered all his Creatures. So that the parts of the Vniuerſe, haue amongſt themſelues that proportion, that in euery one, and all ioyntly, there are found theſe three Circumſtances, weight, number and meaſure. But that, which is ſpoken in the booke of <hi>Wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,</hi> touching the gouernment of all this huge <hi>Machina,</hi> is of greater conſideration. For God touching (as being infinitely powerfull) the extremes and ends of all things in the diſpoſing of them, he doth it with a great deale of ſweetneſſe. He did ſet an inuiolable Law, a ſettled and determinate Seate (as being the Author of Nature) to na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture it ſelfe; to the end, that euery thing conſeruing it ſelfe with in it's owne proper bounds and limits, it ſhould not be confounded with the reſt. And from hence grew a moſt ſweete and pleaſing harmonie of all this great frame
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:180809:65"/>
of the World, ſo well tuned, and ſo well ordred, that it alone voyceth and Proclaymeth the wiſedome, and om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nipotencie of the Creator. What a goodly thing is it, to ſee the continuall Motion of the Celeſtiall bodies? The perpetuall influence, fixedneſſe, &amp; reſplendour of the Planets and of other ſtarres? The fire, in it's ſphere? The Ayre, the Water, and the Earth, in their moſt firme and ſtable Manſions? And only by vertue of that firſt Law which God ſettled in his firſt Creation? Out of this Compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture, and admirable accord, and agreement of things na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall, is to be drawne the politicall conſent and attone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of a Common-wealth, appointing to euery one his ſite, his place, and his certaine limits of Iuriſdiction for that Office, that ſhall be put vpon him, without once thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king to haue it altered or changed. And it is the obſerua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the wiſe, and men of much experience, that if it might bee inuiolably kept, and might bee eſtabliſhed as an inuariable and vnchangeable decree in the breſt of the King and his Counſellours, that thoſe of one Counſell ſhould not be transferred and put ouer to another; nor be remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued from that wherein they are already placed, vnleſſe it be to your Preſidentſhips of your Chanceries, and Viſits of the Kingdome, and that they themſelues of euery parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Councell ſhould haue the nominating of their Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidents, it would in matter of gouernment be of great im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance. Firſt of all, by theſe meanes would ceaſe thoſe anxieties, vexations, and cares, wherewith all of them liue, of being tranſlated from one Councell to another; as alſo that extraordinary negociating and labouring for this end and purpoſe. Thoſe that are of the Councell of <hi>Hazienda,</hi> pretend to be preferred to that of the <hi>Indies, &amp; de los Ordines.</hi> And when they haue attained to theſe, they aſpire to that of <hi>Caſtile.</hi> So that out of this ambitious humour none of them ſticke faſt, or keepe firme footing; but from the very firſt day, wherein they enter into one of theſe Councells,
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:180809:66"/>
their mindes are wandring, pretending to better themſelues by chopping and changing from Councell to Councell. And the miſchiefe of it is; That in theſe Pretenſions, they waſt and ſpend that time, which they ſhould beſtow in ſtudy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thoſe points, which belong to their own Tribunall. For the curing of this ſore, in the Councell of the <hi>Indies,</hi> in former times, thoſe Counſellours had a larger allowance and greater Penſion, then any of the other Councells, obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging them thereby to ſettle themſelues where they were placed, without pretending to budge, or to leape from one Councell into another, making themſelues thereby capable of all thoſe difficult buſineſſes of the <hi>Indies,</hi> which good effect then ceaſed, when the Salaries were made all a like. And if this Order which I ſpeake of, had beene well and truly kept, the diſorder which is in theſe pretenſions of change, had beene remedied, and men would haue beene more practicke, and better ſeene in thoſe buſineſſes, which are treated in euery one of them, being ſo different, and of ſo great conſequence, and ſo hard to be vnderſtood, that they will require the ſtudy and aſſiſtance of many yeares to vnderſtand and know them aright. And (as the holy Ghoſt ſayth) it is contrarie to the rules of good gouernment, and of prudence, to put one vpon that he vnderſtands not, and to commit weighty affayres vnto him, who vndertaking them (as being tyed thereunto by his imployment) knowes not whether he be in the right, or no, though perhaps he preſume he is. Likewiſe, there ſhould be much more care had in the prouiſion of thoſe places of other Audiencies, and inferiour Courtes of Chancerie, to the end that in them might be bred vp ſuch ſubiects, in qualitie, learning, and vertue, that out of them, Election might be made of fit men for greater Counſells.</p>
               <p>And that the Preſidents ſhould be choſen out of the ſaid Councells in which they were bred vp, it is very con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenient, and grounded vpon good reaſon, For, hauing

beene conuerſant in them ſome yeeres, by the concourſe of ſo many things, as dayly offer themſelues, thereby will be better knowen, their talent, and capacitie, their truth, their treating, their integritie, and all the worth and parts of their perſon, whereby the election that ſhall be made, will be much the better, more certaine in the things vnderta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, and more ſafe and ſecure in matter of conſcience. And who is he can doubt, but that thoſe Counſailours, which haue beene for a long time in your ſupremer Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cells, will haue greater knowledge of the qualitie and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of thoſe buſineſſes, which are treated in them, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with thoſe neceſſary circumſtances, which make for their better expedition. Beſides, they will more prefectly know the State, wherein the buſineſſes of that Tribunall ſtand, without being driuen to haue recourſe vnto others to be better informed, ſpending and looſing much time therein. Againe, they know, (which is a matter of no ſmall conſideration) the reſt of the Counſailours, as alſo their condition, their abilitie, their cleanneſſe of hands and heart, and their good, or bad parts, for there, better then elſe where, are they diſcouered. And this know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge is very neceſſary in Preſidents, for to deliberate, and make choiſe vpon all occaſions, of the fitteſt perſons, that are to be truſted, with buſineſſes of importance. And it is of no leſſe conſequence to take notice of the ſuitors and pretenders, for to know how to carry themſelues towards them, &amp; to take particular knowledge of the good cuſtomes, ceremonies, preheminencies and priuileges of thoſe Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cells, that they may be kept and obſerued, and that the authoritie of the Tribunall may be maintained, and all diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordes and Competitions a voyded.</p>
               <p>All theſe things are learned with time, and that expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience which euery one hath of his proper Councell, wherein it is very requiſite, that the Preſident be a Maſter and not a Schollar, as he is, who enters newly into a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell

though he haue ſerued many yeares in another: and of no little inconuenience are the nouelties, which they both attempt and do, who are admitted without this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience, being deſirous to accommodate, and order things according to the meaſure of their own diſcourſe. And how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit the want of experience be in Counſailours a matter of much conſideration, and may be tolerated and borne withall in ſome; yet in realtie of truth, the lacke thereof in a Preſident, is intolerable, and very preiudiciall to the whole Common-wealth; And from thence ariſe many great miſchiefes, and thoſe remedileſſe. For ſome out of ignorance, and ſome out of flatterie, do leane to their opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, whereby many vniuſt decrees paſſe, whileſt the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perienced and wiſer ſort, (which euermore are the fewer) haue not power equall to their ſufficiencie, to turne the courſe of the ſtreame. And for th s reaſon, ſo many dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulties offer themſelues, ſo many differences are raiſed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt them, and ſo many reſolutions delayd and put off, (and peraduenture erre in the end too,) which would haue required a quicke and ſpeedy Diſpatch.

For it matetreth much, that the head be of the ſame ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance as is the body, and that all the members be of one and the ſame kinde, not to haue a head of gold, a body of braſſe, and feete of clay, like vnto <hi>Nabuchodonazars</hi> image, but that all the whole body be one and the ſelfe ſame fleſh and bone, all of the ſame matter and informed with the ſame forme. That bundle of ſheafes which <hi>Ioſeph</hi> ſaw; his (like the King-ſheafe) lifting vp his head higher then the reſt, and (if we may beleeue the <hi>Rabbins</hi>) reaching as high as heauen, and thoſe of his brethren proſtrate on the ground, doing homage thereunto, is the Embleme of the body of a Councell &amp; it's Preſident like vnto that of king <hi>Pharaoh.</hi> And the ſacred Text doth not ſay, that that tall and high ſheafe, was different in matter from the reſt, but that all were of the ſame eare, and ſtalke; giuing vs thereby to vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand, that he, that is to be the Head or Preſident of the whole body of a Councell, though he be to be higher then the reſt, in the dignitie and hight of his Office, yet for all this, God would not, that he ſhould be made of any other kinde of matter then were the reſt of the members; That he ſhould not be ſome great block-headed Lord, or a man without wit, or learning, that in his carriage and manner of life, he ſhould ſeeme to be cut out of another peece of cloath, but that hee ſhould bee of the ſelfe ſame qualitie, faſhion, and profeſſion. And that the Preſident of euery Councell, ſhould be choſen from amongſt the Counſailours themſelues, that they be moulded out of the ſame Maſſe and lumpe, as well the feete, as the head, that there goe (as we ſay) but a payre of ſheares betweene them, and that they be clad all in one and the ſame liuerie.

This rule did that great gouerner of Gods people <hi>Moſes</hi> obſerue, who hauing (as wee ſayd) vſed diligence for to ſeeke out perſons, which might helpe him, furniſhed with thoſe qualites afore-mentioned, made a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribution and diuiſion amongſt them, allotting them places and Offices, anſwearable to their Talent. And which is worthy the noting, that (as he himſelfe affirmeth in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther place) the nobleſt, and wiſeſt amongſt them he made rulers ouer the reſt. For, when in noblemen, concurre the qualities of wiſedome, and prudence, and other the Vertues, there is a great deale of reaſon, nay a ſtrong obligation lyes vpon it, that Preſidentſhips, and the greateſt dignities, &amp; places of honour, ſhould be beſtowed vpon them; eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally, when not degenerating from the Vertue of their Ance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtors, but ſurpaſſing them therein, they haue the aduantage of

nobleneſſe of blood, vpon which vertue (like a Diamond ſet in gold) ſhewes it ſelfe the better and appeares the more beautifull. The words of that moſt wiſe Law-giuer, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this diſcourſe will be the better grounded, are theſe; <hi>Tuli de Tribubus veſtris,</hi>

For it is impoſſible, but, that he that treateth in all buſineſſes, muſt needs erre in ſome, nor can he, that is ouer charged with buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes giue good ſatisfaction vnto all.

<pb n="117" facs="tcp:180809:69"/>

They are like vnto another <hi>Gerion,</hi> of whom it is ſayd, that he is in Hell, becauſe hee would be Three, inſtead of One. What will become then of thoſe, that would be twenty yea a hundred, nay inioy all the Offices in a Kingdome?

               <p>With the foreſayd diſtinction and diuiſion of Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell and Counſailours, farre better and more ſpeedily will buſineſſes be diſpatched, and the King ſhall be at more eaſe in his perſon, and more at quiet in Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.

So good gouernment in like manner is deſtroyed, by the Ambition and Couetouſneſſe of thoſe, who not contented with their imployments and places, draw buſineſſes out of their right Current, for to make themſelues Lords and Maſters of all, and to purſue, by this meanes, their idle vanities, ambitious humours, and particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar intereſt. The Holy Ghoſt, in that Miſticall booke of the <hi>Canticles,</hi> compares the Gouernment of the Church to a well ordred Army, or pitch't field, where the pikes are ranked on the one ſide, the ſhot on the other, the horſe in a third, and all the reſt in their due places appointed for them. And in this well ordring and marſhalling of the Men, conſiſteth the ſtrength of an Army. A Chriſtian, and Church-like Common-wealth, by the good order that
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:180809:70"/>
is kept therein, is as a terrible as an Armie with Banners to it's Enemies, and as beautifull as <hi>Tirzah,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Cant. 6.4,</note> and comely as <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> in the ſight both of God, and Man. And when Kings doe hit right the diſtribution of their Offices, and in giuing to euerie one, that which is fitting for him, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his condition and qualitie, moſt certaine it is, that euerie man ſhall get aduantage thereby and proue more excellent in his proper place and Office, than thoſe can bee, who haue beene imployed in other Offices and places. And that they, who haue beene deputed to ſuch a Councell, and well exerciſed therein, ſhall farre better know what belongs thereunto, than thoſe that haue not had ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience and knowledge thereof. Euermore preſuppoſing, that with the foreſaid care and diligence, choice hath beene made of the moſt ſufficient. For which reaſon, wee are to giue credit to euerie one in particular, and to all ioyntly in their Miniſteries, as to ſelected perſons, and ſuch as are their crafts-Maſters, in theſe kinde of matters. For (as the holy Ghoſt ſaith) <hi>Vnuſquiſque in arte ſua ſapiens eſt:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Eccl.</note> Euerie one is wiſe in his owne Art, knowing therein both how to ſpeake, and doe. According to this ground, Kings cannot doe any thing better or ſurer for the good gouernment of their kingdomes, and ſatisfaction of their Conſciences, than to giue credit to each Councell in that which appertayneth vnto them, and to leaue vnto their or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarie Councellours and Councels the Diſpatch of all your running buſineſſes without any particular Conſulta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, vnleſſe it ſhall more neerely concerne the State, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of as the king ought onely to bee the Iudge, and to giue his reſolution, what hee will haue therein to bee done; So likewiſe muſt hee lend them his hand and authoritie, as farre forth as is fitting, proportionable to the bulke and qualitie of their Office, without which they cannot well exerciſe the ſame. Where as not to giue them that, which they iuſtly deſerue, is a great impediment to their complying
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:180809:71"/>
with the ſubſtantiall part of their obligation, and giues oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion to others, not to yeeld them obedience and reſpect, which are the raynes of that bridle, wherewith the people are to bee reſtrained and ruled. And together with this, they themſelues muſt helpe to ſuſtaine the weight and charge of gouernment, wherein they haue ſo great a portion. The Emperour <hi>Charles</hi> the fift of glorious memorie, was much commended for the great care hee tooke in conſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the authoritie of his Miniſters. And it is not to bee doubted, but thoſe ancient graue Miniſters, whom the people reuerenceth and reſpecteth for the place wherein they are, and for the opinion which they haue gayned by their yeares and experience, and for the authoritie they haue to doe eyther well, or ill, and for that power they poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſe, and which the Lawes grant vnto them ouer mens liues, and goods, may doe much in authorizing, or diſauthori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing not onely all that they doe, but euen the Prince him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe. Hence will iſſue this other benefit, that a great part of your Audiences (too ordinarie a trouble with Kings) will bee much leſſened, whereby they ſhall bee the more diſoc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupied, and recouer greater force and ſtrength for to treat of weightier affaires, not waſting and ſpending the time in matters of leſſer moment. And this bad and old cuſtome ought to haue it's legges broken, and hereafter bee diſina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled for attributing vnto Kings thoſe reſolutions, that are diſagreeable and diſpleaſing to the people. For albeit thoſe ineuitable offences and diſtaſtes, which ſometimes cannot bee auoyded, ought to bee indured and paſſed ouer with diſſimulation, for the publicke good, yet is it not ſafe to procure them for euerie particular thing, nor that all men ſhould know, that all their dammages and hinderances proceede from the ſupreme will of the king. And it is as old, as vſuall a faſhion with your Miniſters, when the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple murmure at them, (I cannot tell whether it bee done with that wiſedome and loyaltie which they owe to their
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:180809:71"/>
King) to lay the fault on their ſuperiour, and the people eaſily intertaineth it, and apprehends it, to be ſo. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon they throw all the ſtones, that they can at him, and although they cannot reach him, yet is it not fit, that they ſhould grow to that inſolency and contempt.</p>
               <p>Let Kings, by all poſſible meanes excuſe thoſe <hi>Iuntas,</hi> or References, which haue lately beene introduced for the deciding of buſineſſes; a thing as ill receiued in common, as deſired by the Miniſters; and that for many reaſons. Firſt, that the people, and the Parties, may not thinke, or ſay, that it is done to oppreſſe them, by putting buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes out of their Courſe, and recommending them to a few ſelected perſons, that they may ſo end them, as he deſireth, who hath the nominating of them. Secondly, that they may not draw vpon themſelues the hatred and bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then of thoſe reſolutions they ſhall take, if they ſhall be either in offence and diſtaſt of the people, or of the Partie whom it concerneth. Thirdly, becauſe there is no cauſe or reaſon, why they, that are truſted with all other publike buſineſſes, ſhould not likwiſe be truſted with particular greiuances. Fourthly, be cauſe your ordinary Councels haue more experience of thoſe buſineſſes, which they treate dayly, then your <hi>Iuntas</hi> haue, which are formed of different Councels, wherin vſually, there are many which ſcarce know the firſt Principles of that, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of they are to treate, &amp; muſt be guided &amp; directed by thoſe, which are taken out of that Councell, which is acquainted with theſe kind of buſineſſes. Or if they will not confeſſe this, by their ignorance, and by their Competition, they deferre at leaſt, if not vtterly ouerthrow the reſolution that ſhould be taken in the buſineſſe. For, being (as they are) compoſed of dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent Tribunalls, they neither loue, nor truſt one another, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther know they how to yeeld each to other, but grow ſtiffe &amp; obſtinate, and attend onely to ſhew their wit &amp; learning vpon thoſe that are vnuerſt in thoſe affaires. Whileſt in the meane while it ſucceedeth with mens buſineſſes, as it doth with thoſe
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:180809:72"/>
diſeaſes and ſickneſſes, which are diſcuſt and debated by many Phyſitians who whilſt they are diuided in opinion, and one would haue this, and another that, the time of the cure is paſt. Fiftly, for the credit and authoritie of the King, as alſo of the Councels themſelues; for when that which belongs to theſe Counſailours and their Preſident, is taken out of their hands by artifice and cunning, and is recommended to others, in no hand can be excuſed the note and ſuſpition, that either the King hath erred in the Election which he made of theſe his Counſellours, or that they do not do their duty, becauſe that which did pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly appertaine vnto them, is taken from them, and put ouer to others. And as it ſhould be a fault in a Prince, not to truſt his Miniſters, if they deſerue to be truſted; ſo is it likewiſe, if they diſmerit that truſt, to continue them in that place. And therefore that Miniſter from whom there can be had no good ſatisfaction, let him be put out of his Office.

For a man is not made of braſſe, that hee ſhould be able to indure the trouble of ſo many <hi>Iuntas,</hi> at leaſt his ſpirits will be ſo ſpent, that he will be able to doe little ſeruice in thoſe that are laſt treated.

ſatisfaction that ſome one particular man that is eminent in the profeſſion of that buſineſſe, which is to be treated, ſhall treate thereof, and ſhall ſee and peruſe it, a gods name (if he will haue it ſo) let his will be fulfilled: yet with all, let his Maieſtie take his opinion, as of a particular perſon, and hauing receiued it, let it be diſputed, diſcuſſed, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bated by the body of the Councell, ſuch as haue beene beaten in theſe kinde of buſineſſes, and are throughly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with theſe matters; for by this meanes, that which is pretended, ſhall the better be effected, and many the fore-mentioned inconueniences be excuſed. Amongſt thoſe Ancient <hi>Romans,</hi> when that Common-wealth was ſole Miſtris of all the world, and when it was likewiſe vnder the Empire and Command of one onely <hi>Monarke,</hi> we neuer read, that it euer admitted of more then the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Councells for the diſpatch of buſineſſes. <hi>Auguſtus Caeſar,</hi> a Prince of excellent prudence, and his great <hi>Minion Mecaenas,</hi> in matter of Counſaile, can ſufficiently confirme this Doctrine, being that he himſelfe was one of thoſe, that treated buſineſſes in the ordinary Councells. And he had a reſpect and conſideration thereunto in that extraordinary cauſe of <hi>Piſo</hi> touching the death of <hi>Germanicus,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Corn.

If the number be not ſufficient for the diſpatch of buſineſſes, let it rather be increaſed, then that by this other courſe, he that is Maſter and Lord of all, ſhould likewiſe make himſelfe Maſter of all wrongs and grieuances, and of that which the aggrieued will conceiue of him; which batching imagination of theirs, will bring forth (that <hi>Cocatrice</hi> of Kings) moſt venemous hatred. By that, which wee haue both read, ſeene and heard, it is eaſie to be collected, that this was meerely an Introduction of the Ambitious, who indeauoured by this meanes to haue all things paſſe through their hands, and depend vpon their will. And this, as if it had beene a thing of inheritance, hath gon along in deſcent from one age to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, euen to theſe preſent our times. That particular Councell which Kings formerly had, and in effect all of them ſtill haue, that more reſerued ſecret Councell with whom they communicate their inwardeſt thoughts, let it (a Gods name) be ſuperiour to all the reſt, which ſupplying, as in thoſe three <hi>potentiae</hi> or faculties, the very place and ſoule as it were of the Prince, it is very fit and conuenient, that it ſhould iudge of the actions, and Reſolutions of all your Ordinary Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cells, and that they ſhould all wayte vpon this, and attend their pleaſure, and that they ſhould likewiſe treate of all thoſe great buſineſſes, which the Ancient, and more eſpecially, <hi>Auguſtus Caeſar,</hi> called <hi>Arcana imperij,</hi> Miſteries of State, and ſecrets of the kingdome. But for the reſt, let them be left to their Ordinary Councells for ſo ſhall they receiue quicker diſpatch, and all ſutes be more eaſily ended, and things carryed with leſſe labour of the one, and fewer com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints of the other. And let it likewiſe ſuffice euen the greateſt intermedlers of theſe Miniſters, that they haue a hand in publicke buſineſſes, without offering for their priuate inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt to draw things out of their ordinary courſe, and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:180809:74"/>
tracke whereinto they were put, making themſelues thereby hated and abhorred of all thoſe that haue any thing to doe with them. For at laſt they will come to ſent and winde out their driftes, to know all their doublings and ſhiftings, and to watch them at euery turne, and when they haue them at aduantage, neuer poore Hare was ſo hardly followed by Hounds, as theſe will be purſu'd to death by them, whom the others powerfullneſſe with his Prince, did ſeeke to cruſh and keepe vnder. It were well that theſe great Miniſters, would weigh and conſider with themſelues, that as they haue their hands already too full of worke, ſo haue they more complaints againſt them, then they would wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly heare of, and more enuie at the heeles of them, then they can well ſhake of, and therefore (if they were wiſe) they would auoyd (as much as in them lyes) to draw theſe miſchiefes more and more vpon themſelues.</p>
               <p>In great reſolutions indeed, Kings are not to giue way, that they ſhould be taken out of the Councells of State, and warre, nor yet that they ſhould be concluded without them.

The principall cauſe, why there was ordained a Councell of State, was; That it might ſerue to helpe the king (whom principally this Body repreſenteth) to beare the Popular charge, which euermore iudgeth of things by the euents; and though now and then they fall out ill, and the people thereupon ready to murmure and mutinie, yet are they the better bridled, and appeaſed by the power and au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:180809:74"/>
of theſe Counſellours. The Office of a King hath trouble inough with it, burthen inough, and therefore they ſhould not aduiſe him to lay more vpon himſelfe without lawfull and neceſſary cauſe. And becauſe, when I treated of the qualities of Counſellours, I reſerued thoſe for this place, which more properly appertaine vnto them that are of this Counſell, I will breifely deliuer what they are, and how neceſſarie for thoſe that are elected thereunto; And I will content my ſelfe with no leſſe, then thoſe of that great Common-wealths man, and Counſellour, <hi>Pericles.</hi> And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, to thoſe which I ſhall now ſpeake of, may be reduced thoſe, which are to be required in their other Councells; your Councell of State, is a Councell of Peace, and War; And (as <hi>Plato</hi> ſaith) is the ſoule of the Republike, and the very An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chor, wheron wholy dependeth all the ſtabilitie, firmeneſſe, &amp; aſſurance, of the State, King, and Kingdome; it's perdition, or preſeruation.

<pb n="128" facs="tcp:180809:75"/>
he treateth; That he vnderſtand them well, and be his Crafts-Maſter in that facultie. That he be of a prompt and ſharpe wit; That his tongue be well hangd, and be able to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe himſelfe ſo happily, that he may be truly vnderſtood. That he haue a minde free from all by reſpects, that nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Loue, nor Feare, may detaine him from vttering what he thinketh; That he beare an eſpeciall loue and affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to his King; That he keepe his hands cleane, and not ſuffer himſelfe to be ouercome by couetouſneſſe. For he, that in whatſoeuer is propounded, preſently apprehends what is beſt, and vnderſtands what is proffitable, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenient, yet neither knoweth, nor hath fitting words to declare himſelfe, it is all one, as if he vnderſtood it not. And he that can play both theſe parts paſſing well, yet loueth not his Maſter, his conſeruation and augmentation of honour, this man will hardly be true and truſty vnto him, and ſcarcely adiuſe him to that which is fitting for him. But ſuppoſe he hath all theſe good qualities, yet if he giue way to be won by the loue of money, and gree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dineſſe of gaine, all that ſhall be treated with him, ſhall be ſaleable, no whit weighing the benefit, and authoritie of his King, if the inſatiable, hunger of riches be put in the ſcale. And I ſay moreouer, that he, that ſhall want theſe two qualities, and ſhall not loue his King, and yet loue Coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touſneſſe, though he be indewed with all the reſt, he ſhall thereby be ſo much the worſe, and more dangerous, for hauing his will depraued, and his vnderſtanding ill affected, hauing theſe two Vices attending on him, how much the more ſhall his ſharpneſſe of wit be, and the greater his force of Eloquence, the worſe effects will it worke, and the more remedileſſe. Let Counſellours therefore haue theſe two qualities, Loue of the heart and cleanneſſe of the hand, together with good naturall partes, as a quicke wit, and nimble apprehenſion, for the ſpeedier determining of preſent buſineſſes, and not onely to giue ſodaine, but
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:180809:75"/>
ſound aduiſe in them. And that in future caſes, they may be able by naturall diſcourſe to giue a gueſſe, how things are like to ſucceede; as alſo, that they may by good diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, and debating of buſineſſes, attaine vnto thoſe things, whereof as yet they haue not had particular experience. That they be prudent diſcerners of the better and the worſe in Caſes doubtfull, that they may not be to ſeeke, but to goe through ſtitch therewith and be prouided for all com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers. In a word, let them be excellent ſodaine ſpeakers vpon all occaſions, aſſiſted as well by a naturall kinde of gift they haue that way, as by the exerciſe of their wit. All which will not ſerue the turne, nor make the Mill go ſo roundly as it would, vnleſſe there be much amitie amongſt them, and a conformitie of good agreement, and a willing helping and aſſiſting one of another in buſineſſes. For, from Competitions and Conteſtations amongſt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, haue inſued the loſſe of Kingdomes, and States, and other great loſſes and Calamities.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Ley.</hi> 29. <hi>Tit.</hi> 9. <hi>Part.</hi> 2.</note> They muſt bee of one accord, and one will with their King, and ſtill aduiſe him to the beſt, hauing an eye both to him and themſelues, that they doe not erre, or doe any thing contrary to that which is right and iuſt. And then is it to be vnderſtood, that they beare true loue to their King, and Countrie, and that they apply themſelues to all that, which concernes the common good, and their owne particular ſeruice, when they take ioy and comfort, that they concurre, and runne all one way without diuiſion or diſtraction. And if this vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie be not amongſt them, it is to be imagined, that they loue not ſo much the King, and State, as their owne priuate intereſt. Being thus qualified, they ſhall be fit Miniſters and Counſellors for ſo great a Counſell, for they ſhall ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by be able to rid as many buſineſſes as ſhall be brought before them, and giue them good and quicke diſpatch, well vnderſtanding what is needefull to be done, and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:180809:76"/>
as well how to declare themſelues in that which they vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand.</p>
               <p>And in this or any other Councell, there ought (accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to <hi>Fadrique Furio</hi>) a care to be had, to examine the merits and diſmerits of euery one, informing themſelues of his life, behauiour, and abilities, as alſo the Actions, of thoſe who without ſuing, deſerue for their vertue, to haue fauour ſhowen them; and likewiſe to take notice of thoſe who deſire this preferment. And that for this purpoſe there be a Regiſter or Booke kept of the merceds, and fauours to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred, and of the perſons that are well deſeruing, to the end that thoſe honours and fauours may be thrown vpon them, according to the vertue, ſufficiencie, and merits of the men. For he, that depriues Vertue of that honour that is due thereunto, doth (in <hi>Cato's</hi> opinion) depriue men, of vertue it ſelfe. And when fauours are afforded thoſe which not deſerue them, or are forborne to be beſtowed on thoſe that merit them, vertue receiues a great affront, and the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth a notable loſſe. And it will proue the greater if honour be added to the bad, and taken from the good; and that vice, ſhall be better rewarded, then vertue. For where ſhe is not eſteemed, and rewarded, the vertuous liue like men affronted, and that are baniſhed the Court. King <hi>Nabucodonoſor, Aſſuerus,</hi> and others, haue kept ſuch a booke as this, wherein were commanded to be recorded the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uices that were done them, and the perſons deſeruing, to the end they might gratifie them, and caſt their gracious fauours vpon them. And this is very neceſſary in all well ordred Common-wealths, to the end that all might indeauour to take paines, and ſtudy to deſerue well. For reward inciteth men to labour; And (as <hi>Saluſt</hi> ſaith) were it not for hope of reward, few or none would be good. It makes much likewiſe for the honor and credit of Kings. For in no one thing can they gaine themſelues greater reputation, then by honouring thoſe, that are good, and vertuous.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="131" facs="tcp:180809:76"/>The <hi>Romans</hi> had likewiſe another Councell which was called by the name of <hi>Cenſura,</hi> or Reforming of manners, which did not in the Common-wealth permit publicke delinquents, which might cauſe either trouble, or ſcandall to the State, and to the end, that ſuch ill diſpoſed perſons, might not eſcape puniſhment. For, where there is neither hope of reward, nor feare of puniſhment, there can we haue no good thing, no Common-wealth, nor no Congregation of men to laſt and continue; when as the good and vertuous are not rewarded, nor the lewd and ſeditious puniſhed. For if one part of the body be infirme, and be not holpen in time, the maladie extends it ſelfe, and goes creeping and ſpreading it ſelfe ouer all the whole body. And therefore it is fitting, that Miniſters ſhould haue an eye, to ſee what vices, what diſorders, what ill corrupted manners diſturbe and moleſt a Kingdome, and to haue a care to cleanſe and cure the Common-wealth of them, dealing with them for the publicke good, as wiſe Phyſitians do for the Bodyes-ſafety Who, in the curing of infirmities, for the ſecuring of the whole, cauterize this or that member, and if neede be cut it off. Now your infirmities and diſeaſes, which are quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly knowne, are as eaſily cured (a great meanes of the reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, reſting in the diſcouerie.) but thoſe which with time waxe olde, grow in a manner incurable; (the Aliment, and fomenting of them, conſiſting moſt in their concealement,) For as in ſuffering and diſſembling a ſore, it but rankles the more, and of ill, becomes worſe; So to beare with inſolent offenders, and to winke at their foule faultes, is; as if a man ſhould fauour a wound too much, wherby, as it, ſo do they daily grow worſe and worſe. For it is too too well knowne, that to malignant diſpoſitions, the more lenitie, is but the more licence of offending, and open mercie proclaimed, Crueltie.</p>
               <p>Let the end of this diſcourſe be, that the Councells and Counſellers being ſeated and ſetled in the forme aforeſaid,
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:180809:77"/>
the King likewiſe apply himſelfe to treat truth with them, and to deale plainely with them, in whatſoeuer buſineſſes ſhall offer themſelues to be debated of. And let him not perſwade himſelfe, that there are too few of euery Councell, for if they be choſen and ſelected men, few will ſuffice; and many, ſerue to no other end but to trouble each other, and to delay buſineſſes. For howbeit it be true, that it is euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more good to heare the opinions of all for to ventilate and ſifte out a cauſe throughly, yet the determination ought to paſſe through the hands of a few, but withall good, and experienced perſons, that they may not erre in their ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence. Of the Emperour <hi>Alexander Seuerus,</hi> (who was a man of ſingular wiſdome) it is reported, that for the reſolution of thoſe buſineſſes, which he vndertooke, he called onely vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him ſuch Counſellours, to whom ſuch buſineſſe did more properly appertaine, and had moſt knowledge and experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence in that,<note place="margin">Aelius Lampr. in vita Alexan.

Which being once well grounded, and both the Conueniences, and Inconueniences throughly weighed, (though in theſe great and weighty affaires, there are neuer ſome wanting, that will follow that part, which hath leaſt ground for it, and yet perſwade themſelues that they onely are in the right, and that all the reaſon in the world is on their ſide) let them goe roundly to worke, and after a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded conſultation, let them ſhew themſelues conſtant in the execution thereof.

                  <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>Rt, is Natures Ape, and imitates her all ſhe can. And by ſo much the more perfect an Artificer, and more cunning workeman is he accounted, who ſhall ſeeme to come neereſt in his worke to that great Maſter and Maker of Nature, and whatſoeuer is naturall, wherein (as hath already beene ſayd) is conſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued and kept that firme and conſtant Law, and firſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement, which he impoſed vpon all things in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of their creation. Who likewiſe hath, and doth ſtill keepe a wonderfull correſpondency in thoſe very things, conſeruing them in their operations, working and opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting continually by their meanes and helpe, and honouring them with the name and eſſence of ſecundary Cauſes, though he himſelfe be the primary naturall cauſe in that working. So that the fire, hath alwaies perfourmed that Office, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in God placed it, to wit; To burne, or heate. And when he hath beene pleaſed to worke theſe effects, he hath made vſe of them for that purpoſe, as well vpon occaſion of his wrath, and chaſticement, as of his loue, and cheriſhment. When he was willing to deſtroy and conſume thoſe Cities of <hi>Sodom</hi> and <hi>Gomorrah,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Gen. 19.24.</note> he did not make vſe of water but of fire, which he ſent among them to execute his iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment

For to drowne the world, he ſerued himſelfe with the water, and in the deſert, he drew water out of the Rocke, to quench the thirſt of his people, and to preſerue them from periſhing. So that Life, Death, and Health, which God can giue ſolely of himſelfe, yet will he haue it be wrought by the helpe and meanes of thoſe ſecundary naturall Cauſes. And euen at the day of iudgement he will make vſe of all theſe, for the puniſhment of the wicked, as we haue it ſet downe in the booke of <hi>Wiſedome;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Wiſd. 5.20.</note> 
                  <hi>Et pugnabit cum illo orbis terrarum con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trà inſenſatos: And the world ſhall fight with him againſt the vnwiſe.</hi> This order and naturall Law, wherewith God conſerueth and gouerneth the world, Kings ought to imitate and follow in the gouernment of their Common-wealths, giuing their Miniſters iuriſdiction and Authoritie propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionable to their Office, without the which they cannot well exerciſe the ſame. And as long as theſe his Miniſters ſhall go on in an orderly Courſe, or ſhall imitate in their conſtancie thoſe naturall cauſes, and ſhall be punctuall and faithfull in their Miniſtries, the gouernment ought not to be alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red or receiue any change. But when they ſhall faile in their obligation, another order muſt be taken with them. And ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I ſay, that in ſome caſes, the beſt &amp; ſureſt courſe that can be taken, is; That Kings proceede after another kinde of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, by being ſerued by other Miniſters, and Counſellers that they may comply with that which tends to the ſeruice of God, and the good of their kingdomes. Eſpecially, when (as hath bin ſaid) Miniſters abuſe that power which is giuen them &amp; make it the meanes to afflict the good, and to doe other
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:180809:79"/>
wrongs and iniuries. And this, the ſacred Scripture teacheth vs in that Hiſtory of <hi>Daniel,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Dan. 3.27.</note> where it is reported, that when <hi>Shadrach,</hi> and his two Companions were caſt into the fiery fournace, the kings Miniſters cauſed the fournace to be heated ſo hot, that the flames of fire aſcended ſome 49. Cubits high. But by how much the more power the fire had for to burne thoſe innocent children in that occaſion, by ſomuch the more to the greater aſtoniſhment of the ſtanders by, God ſlaked the force thereof, cauſing that in that very place, where for to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume theſe Saints, the fire was moſt kindled, a coole freſh ayre entred in, and did refreſh them. And the King himſelfe, who came to ſee this wonder told them, that he eſpied in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panie of theſe three children a fourth man, which ſeemed to be like vnto the ſon of God. For indeed ſo it was, that this his Diuine goodneſſes, did not content it ſelfe with deading the force of that intenſiue flame, but made meanes by his Angell, to come &amp; free theſe Innocents from that torment. Therein, inſtructing kings, That albeit it be fit, that ordinarily, they ſhould ſuffer buſineſſe to paſſe by the hands of thoſe Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, to whom they belong; yet when the ſubiect is extrem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly wronged, &amp; iniuſtice offred by them againſt the Innocent, Kings ought not to reſpect the Order and ordinary courſe of Law, but to take another courſe with them, and (if neede be) wholy to change and alter it, and in his own proper perſon, to direct things to their due ends, taking from the fire it's Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uitie &amp; inſtead thereof ſending a pleaſing coole gale of wind, as God did. For experience teacheth vs, that this ill ſeede or bad race of Miniſters, makes poſt-haſt, &amp; quickly ouerrunnes a Common-wealth, as ill weedes doe a ground, to the great diſhonour of kings, and diminution of their credit, and to the notable dammage and deſtruction of kingdomes. Oh how doth it diſcouer it ſelfe in theſe our vnhappy and miſerable times, how much more, and how many Cubits higher then it was wont, doth the fire of Ambition, and Auarice, mount in many Miniſters, who grow by this meanes to be ſo great, and
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:180809:79"/>
ſo high, that they quite looſe the ſight of themſelues, and goe beyond the reach of their own knowledge, being in a manner beſides themſelues puft vp with their promotion, and the high places they poſſeſſe, ſeeming to be another kind of men, then they were wont to be. And this their folly and madneſſe extends it ſelfe ſo farre, that they will not ſuffer themſelues (forſooth) to be ſeene, or knowne, by thoſe, whom not long ſince (God he knowes) they adored as Gods, but now are growne ſo proud, and into ſo good a conceit of themſelues, that they thinke themſelues to be ſomething more then men. Of theſe, S <hi>Bernard</hi> giues this admirable good note; You ſhall ſee (ſaith he) many in the Church of God, as alſo in Kings Courts, without noble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe made noble, and of poore, become rich, to be ſodain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly puffed vp with pride, forgetting their former Eſtate, to be aſhamed of their Anceſtors, and diſdainfull towards their poore kinſefolke, and by a ſtrong hand, and with lyes and falſhoods, they ſeeke and procure that, which Nature hath deny'd them, and being not noble by birth, nor innobled by vertue, ſet a good face on the matter and by ſuch art and cunning as they will vſe, would ſeeme to the world to be great Princes, and to be well deſcended, fetching their feigned Pedigrees, as farre as <hi>Noahs</hi> flood: Farre vnlike vnto him, who by his vertue came from a Potter, to be a King; who, that he might not forget, whence he came, and yet repreſent what he was, cauſed to be ſet on his Court-cupboord veſſells of earth, with this Letter; <hi>Haec fecimus:</hi> Theſe we once made; and veſſells of gold, with this other Letter; <hi>Iſta facimus:</hi> Theſe we now make. I ſay, that it is a matter of much importance, (and I purpoſly forbeare to ſpeake ſo much as I know in this point) for the conſeruation of Kingdomes. As alſo how fit it is, that their Maieſties, both in regard of that reſpect which is due vnto Kings, and to the right and true adminiſtration of Iuſtice, ſhould by their ſeueritie, temper and moderate the exceſſe
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:180809:80"/>
of thoſe, which cloath themſelues with the Kings royall command, as with a garment, and beare themſelues too in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolently-high vpon the Title of their Offices; and vnder colour and zeale to the ſeruice of their Kings, will make themſelues their Tutors, Maſters of their libertie, Lords, ouer their vaſſalls, and ſole Commanders of the whole Kingdome like vnto that great <hi>Leuiathan,</hi> or huge Whale in the Sea, of whom holy <hi>Iob</hi> ſaith; <hi>Before his face, is pouertie, and want, for he ſpoyleth and deuoureth all that ſtands in his way,</hi>

                  <hi>CHAP. XV.</hi> Whether it be fitting for Kings, to vſe much the remitting of buſineſſes?</head>
               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>Lthough in the former Chapter ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing hath beene ſpoken, which may tend to this Queſtion, yet ſhall it be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to anſwer heere thereunto in a more direct and clearer manner. And howbeit the word, remitting, or refer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, doth ſeeme to notifie the care and poruidence, which a Prince oweth vnto buſineſſes, certaine it is, that it ſhall well beſeeme him, ſometimes ſo to doe. For, amongſt many other the miſeries of humane nature, this is one, that it's forces, as well inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall, as externall, as well of the Soule, as of the body are much limited, and reſtrained, and haue much need of many helpes. Wherefore I ſay, that Kings not being able (as they are not) to attend of themſelues ſo many buſineſſes as howerly occurre, nor to comprehend ſo great variety and difference of things, they ought to remit ſome, nay many
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:180809:80"/>
of them, to perſons deputed for their eaſe, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge of their Conſciences. Let a King examine thoſe buſineſſes, which are fit to bee reſerued for himſelfe. And thoſe that hee cannot, let him remit them vnto others, becauſe of himſelfe hee is not able to diſpatch all of them.</p>
               <p>And in fauour of this Doctrine; wee haue <hi>Iethro's</hi> Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaile to his ſonne in Law <hi>Moſes.</hi> Who ſeeing him ſo ouer-imployed in the buſineſſes of his people to his intolerable trouble, ſaid vnto him; <hi>Stulto labore conſumeris,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Exod. 18.18.</note> 
                  <hi>elige tibi Viros, &amp;c. Thou wearyest thy ſelfe greatly, and this people that is with thee, prouide thee men, &amp;c.</hi> I neede not repeate all vnto you, hauing ſpoken thereof largely heretofore. I ſhall now therefore repreſent vnto you, That there are two kinds of <hi>Remitting.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The one for to vnloade himſelfe of that charge and trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, that hee may liue himſelfe at eaſe, and out of his autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie lay the burthen vpon others, and command them to end ſuch or ſuch a buſineſſe. Which is now too commonly vſed and practiſed. For euerie on, as much as in him lyes, ſtriues to bee ſuperiour in this kind; Taking that to himſelfe which is moſt pleaſing, and eaſieſt for him, &amp; remitting the hardeſt and harſheſt to other mens hands: And hence it happeneth, that from thc firſt remitting the King makes, your poore <hi>Negociants,</hi> like ſo many Tenniſ-balls, are toſt from one to another. Nay, their fortune is farre worſe; for the Ball which is racketed by the one Player, the other with great nimbleneſſe and care, runnes forth to receiue it: But the poore <hi>Negociant,</hi> who in theſe Remitments, ſerues in ſtead of the Ball, they doe not onely not receiue him readily, but ſhut the doore vpon him, obliging him to ſolicite his en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance, one while by fauour, another while by giftes. And although this bee too vſuall a practice in all Tribunalls; and with all Iudges, and vpon all differences of buſineſſes, yet is it there moſt practiſed, where matters of goods and
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:180809:81"/>
Titles of Lands are treated, wherein the Pretenders doe not onely ſweate and take a great deale of paines, but are forced to pay as much for the diſpatch of tenne thouſand <hi>Maraue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,</hi> as if they were ſo many Ducats. And this may be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed with the example of a poore honeſt widdow, who (as it is well knowne) ſpent much time, and that little mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney which ſhee had, in Negociating the diſpatch of a ſmall debt. And when after a long and tedious ſuite, ſhee had at laſt got an order againſt her Aduerſarie, yet was ſhee ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer the neerer getting of her money, for that it was orde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in Court, that ſhee ſhould bee payd out of ſuch Rents, which vpon ſome pre-morgage, or ſome other cunning Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyance, could not bee recouered. Theſe remittings, I doe not finde how they can be defended, or ſalued in the Sacred Scripture. But there are many reaſons for the condemning of them, and for the obliging of kings to limit, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medie them.</p>
               <p>The other kinde of remitting, is; When eyther the order and qualitie of the buſineſſe, or the lawfull Impedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of him that remitteth, doth ſo require it. For which wee haue our Sauiour CHRISTS warrant in that admirable conuerſion of the bleſſed Apoſtle Saint <hi>Paul.</hi> For albeit hee himſelfe, by his powerfull hand threw him downe from off his Horſe, and made him ſo farre forth to yeeld himſelfe his, that hee vttered theſe words ſo full of ſubmiſſion; <hi>Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Act. 9.6.</note> 
                  <hi>quid me vis facere? Lord, what wilt thou that I doe?</hi> Yet did hee not then giue him a preſent abſolute Diſpatch, but remitted him ouer to another Diſciple, which was named <hi>Ananias.</hi> It being held fit it ſhould bee ſo for thoſe reaſons which are rendred by the Saints, and holy Fathers. The like courſe hee tooke with <hi>Cornelius</hi> the Centurion in that great buſineſſe of his Saluation,<note place="margin">Act. 10 5.</note> putting him ouer to Saint <hi>Peter.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Luk. 17.12</note> And when he ſaw the Petition of thoſe tenne Lepers, who beſought him, that hee would make them whole; how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit hee granted them their requeſt for the recouerie of their
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:180809:81"/>
health, yet did he remit them ouer to the Prieſts, and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded them to preſent themſelues before them, becauſe in thoſe kinde of infirmities,<note place="margin">Leuit. 13.</note> they were to be Arbitrary Iudges, what was to be done in that caſe. And to the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of <hi>Iohn Baptiſt</hi> which he ſent vnto him, when he was in priſon, to the end that they might informe themſelues who he was, and whether it was he that ſhould come, or were to looke for another? He remitted them backe to their Maſter with this Anſwer; <hi>Ite, renunciate Ioanni, quae audiſtis, &amp; vidiſtis: Goe and ſhew</hi> Iohn <hi>what things yee heare and ſee.</hi> As if he ſhould haue ſaid,<note place="margin">Mat. 11.4.</note> For as much as <hi>Iohn</hi> is my Voice, by him is the truth to be declared, which you ſeeke after touching the Diuinitie of my Perſon. All theſe Remittings were plaine, and diſpatched without reply; And thoſe doubtleſſe condemned, which are now daily vſed, paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing things ouer from one to another, as if men were to deale with children, who asking a companie of them, that are playing together; Is your Mother at home? All make anſwer; This boy can tell you, or that other boy can tell you. So that many mens liues are ended, before their buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes can be ended. Their ſuites growing older then them ſelues; waſting both their wealth, and their perſons to no purpoſe.</p>
               <p>It is recounted in the Acts of the Apoſtles;<note place="margin">Act. 6.2.</note> That they being ſo buſily imployed in the Preaching of the Goſpell that they could not ioyntly with it attend thoſe workes of Charitie, and Almes-deedes, which were exerciſed in the Primitiue Church, by feeding thoſe that were conuerted, they did remit the care thereof to ſeuen Deacons choſen out from amongſt them all for that Miniſtrie. And heere is to be conſidered a point of Doctrine of great impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance. That the Apoſtles (as there it is mentioned) albe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>it they ſaw what a great charge they had, and how much trouble with daily Preaching, and continuall Praying, they did neither omit, nor remit this buſineſſe, but were won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfull
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:180809:82"/>
carefull, that thoſe to whom this care was remitted, ſhould be perſons of great approbation, and fulfilled with the Holy Ghoſt, and with wiſdome, as were S. <hi>Steuen,</hi> and others, which were elected, and ioyned in Commiſſion with him. <hi>Conſiderate ergo fratres, viros ex vobis boni teſtimonij Septem, plenos Spiritu Sancto, &amp; ſapientia, quos conſtituamus ſuper hoc opus, &amp;c.</hi> Wherefore brethren, Looke you out among you ſeuen men of honeſt report, and full of the Holy Ghoſt, and of wiſdome, which we appoint to this buſineſſe. Which is a Leſſon for Kings, that when they vnderſtand, that the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, to whom they vſe to remit buſineſſes, are not ſuch as they ought to be, either for their want of wiſdome, or expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience in thoſe things, or that their minde is not cleare and free from paſſion, &amp; couetouſneſſe, they in no manner of wiſe diſcharge their Conſciences in making ſuch remitments and references, but ought rather to reſerue the diſpatch therof vnto themſelues, or to remit them to ſuch Miniſters, that are able to giue good ſatisfaction therein, and of whoſe good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and ſufficiencie, the world rendreth publicke Teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny. In a word, I am of opinion, that to remit buſineſſes, is a matter of neceſſity, in regard of the ſhortneſſe of our vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, which is imbroiled and mightily hindred with this multiplicitie of affayres, and oftentimes choaked and ſtifled, and made defectiue in thoſe matters, that are moſt neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. And as for our bodily ſtrength, the force thereof is ſo ſmall, and ſo weake, that we had neede to preſerue the ſame, by eaſing it of that burthen, which is too heauy for it to beare. Yet withall there muſt a great care be had, that theſe remitments, be not made meerely, that the King might liue at eaſe, and be idle, but becauſe weighty buſineſſes, and ſuch as haue neede of new Examination, and new diligencies, doe require it; or becauſe the King (as already hath beene ſayd) may haue ſome lawfull impediment. Let Kings haue recourſe vnto God, and he will illighten them, and their faces ſhall not ſuffer confuſion,<note place="margin">Pſal. 2.10.</note> nor their Kingdomes ſee alterations,
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:180809:82"/>
ruines, nor deſtructions. <hi>Erudimini, qui iudicatis terram: Be wiſe therefore yee Kings; be learned, yee Iudges of the earth.</hi>

               <p>The other is more eleuated, and more ſpirituall, and flies a higher pitch, as when it diſcernes things with Aduice, and diſcourſe, and when it perceiues what that is, that it ſees, and this appertaineth onely vnto Man.

But not like thoſe Kings, that viſited holy <hi>Iob,</hi> who although they ſaw him, and were ſeuen dayes with him, yet did they not ſee, what they ſaw; My meaning is, That albeit they did ſee the great affliction, and extreme miſerie, wherein poore <hi>Iob</hi> was, their eyes paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed it ſlightly ouer, they did not dwell vpon it, nor tooke any courſe to giue him remedie. And when this is not done, their ſeeing, is no ſeeing, but are like vnto thoſe ſpoken of by the <hi>Pſalmiſt; That haue eyes, and ſee not,</hi> Dull Idolls. To this purpoſe, there is a prety place in the firſt of the <hi>Machabees,</hi> where, after the Author hath made report, of
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:180809:83"/>
the great wickedneſſe, and Tyrannies, which that accurſed King <hi>Antiochus,</hi> and his Miniſters, exerciſed in Ieruſalem, and in other Cities and Townes of the Kingdome of <hi>Iudaea,</hi> of that great Captaine <hi>Mattathias,</hi> and his fiue Sonnes, hee ſpeaketh thus; <hi>Hi vederunt mala, quae fiebant in populo Iuda, &amp; in Ieruſalem</hi> which the vulgar renders thus, Now when they ſaw the blaſphemies,<note place="margin">1. Mac. 2.6.</note> which were committed in <hi>Iuda</hi> and <hi>Ieruſalem.</hi> Theſe (ſaith he) ſaw the euills, that were committed in <hi>Ieruſalem;</hi> And my thinkes here muſt the queſtion be asked, Why all they of that Common-wealth, ſuffering ſo many oppreſſions, and ſo many afflictions, in their Houſes in their own Perſons, &amp; thoſe of their children, onely <hi>Mattathias,</hi> and his Sonnes, are here ſaid to haue ſeene theſe euills, and theſe blaſphemies? The anſwer here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto, makes notably for our purpoſe, becauſe it expreſſeth that, which we go inforcing; To wit, That to ſee buſineſſes, is truely and properly, to vnderſtand them, and to put our helping hand vnto them. And becauſe <hi>Mattathias,</hi> and his Sonnes, were the onely men that were ſenſible of the hard meaſure they receiued, and the firſt that roſe vp, and oppoſed themſelues againſt the furie of the Tyrant, for the remedying their ſo many and ſo great Calamities, that ſacred Hiſtorian ſaith, That they onely had eyes, and ſaw the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction of Gods people. This kinde of ſight beſt be fitteth Kings, as they are heads of their Kingdomes and Common-wealthes, and it is likewiſe neceſſary, that they haue their ſight, Large, Cleare, and Sharpe, that they may reach to ſee euen thoſe things, that are moſt ſecret, and moſt remote, as doth that princely birde the Eagle, which houering aloft in the ayre deſcryes the fiſhes, that are in the deepe: Or be like vnto that Maieſticall Creature the Lyon, who both waking, and ſleeping, keepes his eyes open. The Holy Ghoſt ſaith; That a wiſe man hath his eyes in his head.<note place="margin">Eccl. 2.14.</note> 
                  <hi>Sapientis oculi in capite eius.</hi> And it ſeemeth, that by Contrapoſitions, he would giue vs thereby to vnderſtand, that a foole hath his eyes in
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:180809:84"/>
his feete. Which as they diſcouer but little, ſo are they lyable to a thouſand offences, and deceits. But the wiſe man be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holds from high and as from a watch-Tower diſcouers things a farre off; and is thereby better able to take notice of them, and more punctually to comply with his obligati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to the ſtate, and to that which neede ſhall require in thoſe accidents that may occurre. This is that ſight, which (as before hath beene ſaid) befitteth Kings, for that they are the Heads of their Common-wealths, and therefore are to reſerue for their own view thoſe the more weighty buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes of their ſubiects; there being a great deale of reaſon, that they ſhould ſee them (as they ſay) with their owne eyes. For this end, are thoſe Viſitations ordayned, and thoſe Entrances in State, which Kings are wont to make into the Cities, and Prouinces of their Kingdomes. When the arrogant and vaine preſumption of men grew to that paſſe, that for to celebrate their name, they went about to build that proud Tower of <hi>Babel,</hi> with intent to touch euen heauen it ſelfe with the top thereof, and to liue free from all feare of a ſecond flood, that ſacred Hiſtorie tells vs; <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcendit autem Dominus vt videret Ciuitatem,</hi>

God came down himſelf to ſee this their ſo great inſollencie that he might puniſh them accordingly, as he did with ſuch a confuſion of languages, that one could not vnderſtand an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, and were amongſt themſelues, as ſo many ſtrangers, without being able to communicate and conuerſe together; ſo that they were driuen to diuide themſelues into different Countries, and were ſcattred from thence vpon all the earth. And in the ſaid Hiſtorie of <hi>Geneſis,</hi> we read, that when that abhominable filthines of the Sodomites, grew to that highth of impudencie, that it prouoked God vnto Wrath, and in a manner bound him to conſume them with fire from heauen, he vttered vnto <hi>Abraham</hi> theſe words worthy the

As if he ſhould haue ſayd; Howbeit the abomination of theſe accurſed So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domites and Gomorrhaeans, hath ſo farre increaſed, that it doth cry aloud vnto me for vengeance and chaſticement, and hath pierced the heauens, and come vnto mine eares, yet notwithſtanding, (becauſe it is a thing that concernes a whole Common-wealth, and a buſines of that weight, as to deſerue exemplary puniſhment,) I will goe downe and ſee, whether it be ſo or no, as the report goes of it. Though moſt certaine it is, that God hath no need to come downe from heauen, to take a particular viewe of the things of this world, for he is preſent in all places, here, &amp; there, and eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry where, he filleth all, ſeeth all, and with his infinite wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome comprehendeth all. But the Scripture ſpeakes in this kinde of language, that it may accommodate it ſelf to the ſtile and capacitie of men, for to inſtruct Kings in this place, that graue and weighty buſineſſes, they are not to transferre them ouer vnto others, but of, and by themſelues to ſee and looke vnto them, nor ought they too be to facile in giuing credit to fame, and report (eſpecially of the vulgar) without hauing firſt fully informed himſelfe thereof, and that by themſelues they ſhould be able to diſ-deceiue themſelues, and to ſee, and conſider things with attention, and with a deſire to ſearch out the truth, and to rectifie what is amiſſe.</p>
               <p>In the Kingdomes of <hi>Caſtile,</hi> there is a very commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble cuſtome, and of great authoritie, and Maieſtie, worthy thoſe moſt prudent Kings which firſt ordeyned it. And this is that <hi>Conſulta,</hi> which euery friday towards the Euening,
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:180809:85"/>
the Preſident of <hi>Caſtile</hi> makes with thoſe of his Maieſties Councell Royall, wherein an Account is giuen vnto his Maieſtie of all the weightieſt buſineſſes, and wherein the opinion and the authoritie Royall is neceſſarie. And this is not without example in the ſacred Scripture. For in the firſt chapter of <hi>Deut.</hi> it is written; That when that great Law-giuer <hi>Moſes</hi> had named for good and quicke diſpatch ſuch Counſellours (as before ſpecified) giuing them in charge what they were to keepe and obſerue, and how to adminiſter Iuſtice with equalitie, and without exception of perſons, he told them; <hi>Quod ſi difficile vobis viſum aliquid fuerit,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Deut. 1.17.</note> 
                  <hi>referte ad me &amp; ego audiam.</hi> The cauſe that is too hard for you, bring vnto me, and I will heare it, You ſhall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult with me in that caſe, that I may heare it, and take ſuch courſe therein as is fitting. And if to this ſo commendable a <hi>Conſulta</hi> of euery Friday weekely, there ſhould bee added another Meeting ſome certaine dayes in the yeare, to the end that the Preſident, and thoſe of the Kings <hi>Camaera,</hi> ſhould carry with them the <hi>Conſulta</hi> of the Offices, and ſhould treate and conferre thereof by word of mouth with our Lord the King, it would be one of the moſt important things (in the iudgement and opinion of many graue men, whom I haue conſulted with in this particular) that could be or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordained for the good of theſe Kingdomes. Whereby many of thoſe inconueniences would be auoyded, which wiſe and Chriſtian Counſellours haue found out by many yeares ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience. And none of the meaneſt (amongſt the reſt) is the remitting by writing ſo weightie and important a thing, as the Election of Officers, recommending the ſame to a dead Letter, which can make no replie. And that paper, which paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth through ſo many hands, cannot come ſo clean, as it ſhuld but be ſullyed, eſpecially if it come to ſuch hands as are not clean, but corrupted with gifts, &amp; preſents. And becauſe this Courſe is taken, the loue &amp; reſpect due to their Kings is loſt, who like Creatures to their Creator, ought to acknowledge al that they haue from his hands. Wheras now, they giue this
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:180809:85"/>
reſpect vnto his Maieſties Miniſters, with whom they haue held correſpondency, as knowing that their Prouiſion muſt ſolely paſſe through their hands, and that their good or bad diſpatch conſiſtes in them, or in a leſſe full, or more effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all Relation, incloſed in the paper of their <hi>Conſulta.</hi> Which cannot be carryed thus, when the Preſident, and thoſe of the <hi>Camera</hi> ſhall haue propounded the ſame, and deliuered their opinions in the preſence of their King. And queſtionleſſe, they that by this meanes ſhould be prouided for, would e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteeme in more, and treat with more punctuality and truth, the things appertaining to his Office, conſidering that the King himſelfe taketh particular knowledge of them. For (as we ſaid before) it is very meete and conuenient, that Kings ſhould know, and communicate with, if not all, yet at leaſt thoſe, who are to be placed in your greater kinde of Offices, and dignities. And amongſt all other buſineſſes, this is that, which with moſt reaſon doth require the Kings eyes and preſence, his remembrance, and mature Counſaile; For ſuch are the Citizens as are their Gouernours, and the Pariſhio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, as their <hi>Paſtors.</hi> And though this perhaps cannot be performed ſo punctually and preciſely, as were to be wiſhed, yet at leaſt it will be needfull, that thoſe perſons, of whom they take teſtimonie, and receiue information in ſo graue and weighty a buſines, ſhould be of that prudence, learning, and authoritie, and ſo beyond all exception, that the world, (which is apt to take exceptions) may be perſwaded, that the Election could not but be paſſing good, being that it paſt through ſuch iudicious mens hands. For, whatſoeuer ſhall come forth decreed by them, it is not fitting, that it ſhould bee ſubiect to their cenſures, who either haue not the ſaid qualities, or are much inferiour in them, or faile in their zeale to God, or their Loyaltie and Loue, to their King being <hi>Narciſſus</hi>-like, inamoured with their owne ſhadow, and led away with the blindneſſe of their paſſion. Woe be vnto that Common-wealth, King, and Kingdome, where one out of

And in the opinion of vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding people, it ſeemeth, that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing is more properly his, then to quit wrongs, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mooue iniuries. For, if we ſhall but conſider that firſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning which Kings had, that which the Ancient ſaid of them, and that which the holy Scripture teacheth vs, wee ſhall finde, that this Occupation is very properly theirs, and that this Care appertaines of right to their greatneſſe. That moſt wiſe King <hi>Salomon,</hi> in the fourth of <hi>Eccleſiaſtes,</hi> ſaith; That when he ſaw the teares of the Innocent, and the wrongs they receiued, and no body to helpe them, or to ſpeake ſo much as a good word for them, it ſeemed a thing more terrible vnto him, then to dye, or neuer to haue beene borne.<note place="margin">Eccl. 4.1.</note>

And not onely King <hi>Salomon,</hi> but euen God himſelfe was ſo highly offended with thoſe wrongs and oppreſſions, which the children of Iſrael ſuffred in Egypt, that he thought it a thing worthy his preſence, and his comming downe from heauen to ſee the ſame with his own eyes. <hi>Vidi afflictionem populi mei in Egypto,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Exod. 3.7.8.</note> 
                  <hi>&amp; clamorem eius audiui propter duritiem eorum, qui praeſunt operibus et ſciens dolorem eius, deſcendi, vt liberem eum.</hi> I haue ſeene the trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of my people, which are in Egypt, and haue heard their crie, becauſe of their Taske-Maſters; And for I know their ſorrowes, therefore I am come downe to deliuer them, &amp;c. Teaching Kings, That in matter of grieuances, and oppreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Innocent, they are not content to themſelues, with remitting them ouer vnto others, but to looke thereunto themſelues; And (if need were) to come from forth their princely pallaces, and to forgoe for a while their pleaſures and their eaſe, till they haue reformed what is amiſſe. The firſt words the diuine Scripture ſtorieth, which the firſt King, whom God choſe for his people, ſaid, were theſe,<note place="margin">1. Sam. 11.5.</note> 
                  <hi>Quid habet populus, quod plorat?</hi> What ayleth this people, that they weepe? Who no ſoner ſaw himſelfe Crowned King, and put by Gods hand into the poſſeſſion of that kingdom, but applying himſelfe to that which he ought firſt of all to doe (as one of the maineſt points of his dutie) he hearkned vnto the cryes of the people, who were oppreſſed by the <hi>Philiſtims,</hi> and with great ſpeede, and feruent zeale, did
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:180809:87"/>
roundly ſet himſelfe to the redreſſing of that oppreſſion. And I verily perſwade my ſelfe, that all good Kings would doe the like, if they ſhould ſee their ſubiects ready to fall into their enemies hands, with whom they wage open warre. But from thoſe more cloſe and ſecret enemies, which are to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with vs ſubiects, Citizens, neighbours, Countrymen and Miniſters of the ſame Kings, and of whom there is held ſo much truſt and confidence, who goes about to free the wronged? What reparation is there for receiued iniuries? Are they not much greater then thoſe, that the <hi>Philiſtims</hi> offered to Gods people, and more remedileſſe? As for pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed Enemies, againſt them we may make open reſiſtance, and euery man, that is not vnnaturall, or a Traytour to his Country, will put to his helping hand, and ſeeke to repell force by force, &amp; reuenge the wrongs that are done them. But for theſe our domeſtick enemies, theſe our home-borne foes, &amp; feigned friends, who vnder the ſhew of friendſhip, and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der cloake and colour of being the Kings Miniſters, oppreſſe the poore, and ſuch as haue little power to oppoſe their greatneſſe, who ſhall be able to reſiſt them? If he, that ſuffers, ſhall pretend to doe it, doth he not put himſelfe in manifeſt danger of ſuffring much more? if not of looſing all that hee hath? And it is worthy your conſideration, that in thoſe words related in <hi>Exodus,</hi> it is not ſaid, that God went down to ſee, and remedy the wrongs which that Tyrant king <hi>Pharaoh</hi> did vnto the children of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> but that which was offred them by his chiefe Miniſters; <hi>Propter duritiem eorum, qui praeſunt.</hi> For the hard-heartedneſſe, and cruelty of thoſe, which were ſet in authoritie ouer them. As if he ſhould haue ſaid, The Affronts and Iniuries done by a Kings principall Officers, are not ſo eaſily remedyed, as thoſe of particular men. They require a powerfull hand, they require Gods preſence, and aſſiſtance, and will craue a Kings eſpeciall care. For your Councells cannot doe it, nay are not able for to doe it of themſelues alone, be they the greateſt and the
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:180809:87"/>
higheſt in the Kingdom; be they neuer ſo zealous of Iuſtice, neuer ſuch true louers thereof, and neuer ſo deſirous to doe right. And the reaſon therof (in my poore opinion) is, for that in regard the burthen of ordinary buſineſſes is ſo great, that only they are not able to attend the quitting of thoſe <hi>agrauios</hi> and greiuances, with that ſpeedines and efficacie, as were needefull, but rather that they themſelues, without ſo much as once dreaming thereof, doe vſe to make them farre grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter then otherwiſe they would bee, for want of time, and ſtrength of body, to cumply with ſo many and ſo great buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes. And it oftentimes ſo commeth to paſſe, that thoſe that ſue for reliefe, in ſtead of being eaſed of their wrongs, receiue further wrong, either becauſe they cannot finde fit place and time to be heard, or becauſe being heard, they are ſoone forgot, or becauſe they that wrong them, finde meanes to couer their faultes. And if they cannot couer them, and ſo ſhould be lyable vnto puniſhment, yet they that lent them their hand to lift them vp to the place wherein they are, will likewiſe lend them a hand to defend their diſorders. And it hath beene already, and is yet daily to be ſeene, that a Iudge in Commiſſion, who for his wickedneſſe and euill dealing deſerued exceeding great chaſtiſement; yet, for that he hath his <hi>Patron</hi> and <hi>Angel</hi> of Guard (for in your grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Tribunalls, theſe are neuer wanting) the buſineſſe is huſht, and the party peccant neuer queſtioned. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he ſhall not be diſgraced, if the matter proue fowle a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him, by putting him out of his place, he that tooke him into his protection, will intercede in his behalfe to haue him remoued from that Office, and preferred to a better; A caſe certainly worthy both puniſhment, and remedy, if there be any vpon earth. And if there be any helpe to be had, it muſt be by the ſight and preſence of the King, for without this, it is not to be hoped for.</p>
               <p>The Courtes of Kings, (much more then other places) are full of humane reſpects, and theſe haue taken ſo great a
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:180809:88"/>
head and are growne ſo ſtrong, that in buſineſſes they ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw that, which truth and iuſtice ought to vphold. And therefore my aduiſe vnto Kings is, that being they are men, that are or may be free (if they will themſelues) from theſe poore reſpectiue conſiderations, and are ſupreme Lords, and abſolute ſoueraignes in their kingdomes, they would be plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, to diſ-agrauiate thoſe that are iniuryed, reſpecting onely wronged right, and oppreſſed Truth. But becauſe ſuch as are wronged, and finde themſelues agrieued, haue not that eaſie acceſſe and entrance into Princes Courtes, or to their perſons, either in regard of their great and weighty Imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, or ſome other lawfull Impediments, it ſhall much im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porte, that in their Courtes, they ſhould haue ſome perſon, or perſons, of great zeale and approued vertue and prudence to whom thoſe that are agrieued ſhould haue recourſe. For many ſuffer much, that cannot come to be admitted to the ſight, or ſpeech of their King, whereas, if there ſhould be a perſon appointed for to heare their Complaints, they would cry out with open mouth for iuſtice, and ſhould be righted in their receiued wrongs. And that perſon, or perſons thus deputed by their Maieſties, hauing firſt well weighed and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amined the reaſons of their Complaints, ſhould afterwards repreſent the ſame vnto their Kings, and giue them true in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation thereof, to the end that they may forthwith by expreſſe Command, put thereunto a ſpeedy and fitting re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medie. And this (I aſſure you) would be a great bridle to reſtraine the inſufferable inſolencie, and Auarice of Princes Miniſters; Who (queſtionleſſe) would carry themſelues much more fairely and vprightly, when as they ſhall know, that their diſorders ſhall faithfully be repreſented. Whereas (on the contrarie) it is not to be imagined with what a bold, nay impudent daringnes they outface goodneſſe, when as they conceiue that of their kings, which was vttred by that vnwiſe and fooliſh Atheiſt;<note place="margin">Pſal. 14.1.</note>

So in like ſorte ſay theſe bad Miniſters, Tuſh this ſhall neuer come to our Kings knowledge, hee is taking his plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure in his gardens, he is thinking on his Hawking and Hunting, or ſome other ſports and paſtimes to recreate himſelfe withall; nor ſhall Tricks, and inuentions be wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting vnto vs to ſtop vp all the paſſages to his eares; but ſay open way ſhould be made, and that the King ſhould take notice of this, or that miſdemeanour, it ſhall be dawbd vp ſo handſomely, ſuch a faire varniſh ſet vpon it, and ſo ful of excuſes, that it will be all one, as if he had neuer heard of it, or any ſuch thing bin at all. Preſuming, that Kings, rather then they will be troubled with buſineſſes of clamour and noyſe, will (for their owne eaſe) ſlightly paſſe them ouer. Wherein, as they haue oftentimes found themſelues, ſo it is fit they ſhould ſtill, be deceiued. And truly to no man, can with better Title this Entrance be giuen, nor this golden key to the Kings Chamber be committed, then to him, who with the integritie and zeale of an <hi>Elias,</hi> ſhould trample and tread theſe Monſters vnder foote; and roundly and throughly to take this care to task, which (without al doubt) would be one of the gratefulleſt, and moſt acceptable ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uices, which can be done vnto God both in matter of pietie, and of pitie. But what ſhall I ſay of the Kings happineſſe in this caſe? With nothing can he more ſecure his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, then with this. As one who is bound, out of the duty of his place, to haue a watchfull eye ouer all his Miniſters, but more narrowly and neerely, to looke into the water of thoſe that are the great Ones; being likewiſe obliged graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:180809:89"/>
and patiently to heare thoſe, that ſhall complaine of them, it not proceeding out of ſpleene and malice, but out of a deſire, to iuſtifie the truth, to make good a good cauſe, and that the fault may be puniſhed, with whom the fault is truly found. For, when the ſubiects iuſt Complaints are not heard, beſides that his conſcience is charged and clogg'd therewith, the Miniſters themſelues become thereby much more abſolute, and more inſolently Imperious; Inſomuch that the ſubiect ſeeing, that they are neither heard, nor eaſed of their grieuances, they grow deſperate. And what fruites deſpaire bring forth, I neede not tell kings, that know either men, or bookes. There is not in holy Scripture any one thing more often repeated, then the particular care which God hath of the oppreſſed. In the ſeuenty ſecond <hi>Pſalme,</hi> where the Greatneſſes of King <hi>Salomon</hi> are ſet forth, but more particularly thoſe magnificencies of that true King <hi>Salomon, Ieſus Chriſt,</hi> whoſe figure he was, amongſt other his Excellencies, for the which he ought to be much eſtemed, beloued, and adored of all the Kings of the earth, and ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued by all the nations of the world, this which followeth is not the leaſt.<note place="margin">Pſal. 72.11.</note>

And though ſome may conceiue, that the cauſe of thoſe and the like troubles, are the croſſe Incoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Kings and Princes amongſt themſelues, or the greedy deſire of warre for ſpoyle and pillage, which pardoneth no manner of perſons, yet in realtie of truth it is not ſo, but the wrongs of Miniſters, exerciſed vpon the poore, the father<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe,

For without it, the foot that ſets forward, falls backward; and a King hath not where withall to relye on his power, his forces, his wiſedome, and experience in gouernment, if he be defectiue in this. For kingdomes laſt no longer, then Iuſtice laſteth in them. And true it is, that there is no winde ſhut vp in the bowells of the earth, which cauſeth therein ſuch violent effects of Earth-quakes, as in thoſe kingdomes, which thinke themſelues ſureſt and firmeſt doe the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints, and greiuous ſighes of the wronged poore. And therefore let none whatſoeuer, be they Kings, great Miniſters, or Counſellours of State, ſlightly reckon of the cries of the poore; For they referring their reuenge to God, they draw him downe from Heauen to right their quarrell. And the baſeſt, and moſt barbarous man in the world, when he ſees himſelfe wronged, and can finde none vpon earth to pleade his cauſe, or to doe him right, he preſently lifts vp his eyes vnto Heauen, and makes his addreſſe vnto God, aſſuring himſelfe that his helpe will come from thence. And it was well ſaid of a Wiſe man; That the wronged are like vnto thoſe that are ready to be drowned, who if they faſten vpon any thing, neuer let it goe: ſo theſe men, when they are in danger to be ſunke by being forcibly kept vnder water by the oppreſſours hand, lay faſt hold on complaints, cryes,
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:180809:91"/>
ſighes, and teares, as the laſt remedy allotted them by God; who ſaith: That he will heare the petitions, and receiue the Memorialls of the afflicted, which are written with teares. <hi>A maxilla enim aſcendunt vſque ad caelum.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ecel.</note> For from the cheeke, they aſcend vp to heauen. They trill downe the cheekes, till they fall to the ground, and from thence they mount vp as high as Heauen: for being water, they riſe as much as they fall. And when God ſees they haue reaſon on their ſide, and that they onely call vnto him for iuſtice, (it being ſo proper an Attribute vnto him) in the end he grants, and ſignes their requeſt. Nor is it much, that he ſhould ſhew them this fauour, his bowells being moued to compaſſion, in ſeeing his creatures in ſuch extremities of af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction. Let Kings therefore beware and take heede, and their Miniſters bethinke themſelues; that in ſuch a caſe, an Inundation of teares, is of more force, and more danger, then that of the ſwifteſt Torrent vpon a mighty flood.</p>

which the vnderſtanding of neither Men, nor Angels once is able to comprehend. And that which we haue ſpoken of the ſence of the ſight ought likewiſe to be ſaid of this, For as far forth as is the perceiuing of a Voyce, or ſome other noyſe, or ſound by the hearing, ſo farre is it common as well to brutes beaſtes, as to Men. But it is proper only vnto Man, by hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring a ſignificatiue voyce, to diſcourſe thereof, and to vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand the inward conceipt of him that ſpeaketh: And from hence will we draw, what ought to be heard by the Head of a Common-wealth: who is not onely to content himſelfe with hearing the bare externall Voyce, but to heare it in ſuch maner as the holy Scripture telleth vs, God heareth the voyces of thoſe, which call vpon him in the time of their trouble, which is a vſuall and plaine kinde of Language in the Diuine Writt. And when it is ſayd, that God heareth vs, it is ioyntly ſayd, that he graunteth our pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition; Whereof many Teſtimonies are found in the <hi>Pſalmes</hi> of <hi>Dauid,</hi> and in diuerſe other places. <hi>Càum inuocarem,</hi>

In the very next Verſe following a double mention is made, That God heard the voyce of the childe: Which was in effect to ſay, that he did releiue him, and refreſh his thirſty Soule, and granted that, which the infant, and his mother deſired. And the Apoſtle Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> in that Epiſtle which hee wrote to the <hi>Hebrewes</hi> ſaith of our Sauiour Chriſt; That,

So that in rigour of holy Writ, Gods Hearing, and Gods Gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting is all one. But in that common Commerce with men, and in that ſtyle, which Kings and their Miniſters vſe, it is not ſo. For they heare, and hearing anſwer, that they haue heard that, which they neuer meane to grant. And there is no worſe Anſwer for a ſuitor, then to make this anſwer to his petition, That it hath beene heard. And it is very fit, that they ſhould reply in this kinde of phraſe: for thereby is gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen to be vnderſtood the great obligation they haue to heare, as well thoſe that haue iuſtice, as thoſe that pretend to haue it, although they haue it not. In ſignification whereof, the two eares are placed on the two contrarie ſides of the head, one oppoſite to the other, becauſe affording one eare to the Plaintiffe, we muſt reſerue the other for the defendant.

your ſubiects, &amp; will not giue them leaue to ſpeake vnto you, leaue to be king; for there is no reaſon he ſhould be a king, that cannot finde a time to cumply with his dutie. Conuin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced with this reaſon, without any more adoe, he preſently gaue a gracious Audience not onely to her, but many moe beſides. For Kings, which doe not heare, by conſequence do not vnderſtand; And not vnderſtanding they cannot go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerne; And not gouerning, they neither are, nor can be Kings. The <hi>Cretans,</hi> painted their God <hi>Iupiter</hi> without cares, becauſe he was that ſupreme king, that gaue lawes, and iudged all. And therefore ought to cary an equall eare, &amp; indifferently to heare all parties after one and the ſame ſelfe manner. Other ſome, did allow him eares, but ſo placed them withall, that they might heare thoſe leaſt, that were behinde him; Which was held a fault in their God; as likewiſe it is in Kings, not to heare any but thoſſe that ſtand before them, or ſide by ſide are ſtil weighting at their elbow. Kings ſhould heare as many as they poſſibly can, and (which is the onely comfort of ſuitors) in that gratious and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing kinde of maner that no man ſhould depart diſcontented from their feete, being a maine fundamentall cauſe, to make all men to loue, reuerence, and eſteeme them; and likewiſe to oblige Princes, to lend the more willing and patient eare to their ſubiects. And of this ſubiect, <hi>Pliny,</hi> in commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his Emperour <hi>Traiane,</hi> tells vs, that amidſt ſo many cares of ſo great an Empire as his was, he ſpent a great part of the day in giuing Audience, and with ſuch ſtilnes and quietnes, as if he had beene idle, or had nothing to doe. And that he knowing the content that his ſubiects tooke in their often ſeeing of him, and ſpeaking with him, ſo much the more liberally, and longer, he afforded them occaſion and place, for to inioy this their content. For nothing doth ſo much pleaſe, and ſatisfie the heart of a Prince, as to conceiue, that he is beloued, and generally well affected of all his ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects. Let a King then, (this courſe being taken) perſwade
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:180809:93"/>
himſelfe, that his people loueth him, and deſireth to ſee him, and to ſpeake dayly (if it were poſſible) with him. And that they take a great deale of comfort, that they haue ſeene him, and he heard them. And that of two things which all de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire, To wit; To be heard, and relieued; The firſt, intertaines, and comfortes the ſuitor; and makes him, with a cheerefull minde, to hope well of the ſecond. Let him heare, though it be but as he paſſes by from place to place, and let him not let any day paſſe, without giuing ordinary Audience at a ſet hower, and for a ſet time. And in caſe any ſhall require a more particular and priuate Audience, a gods name, let him grant it them; For euery one of theſe (to conceiue the worſt) cannot deceiue him aboue once; And it is to be ſuppoſed, that they will not be ſo vnciuill, or ſo fooliſhly indiſcreete, as to craue the Kings priuate eare, but in a caſe of neceſſitie, or where there is ſome eſpeciall cauſe, or extraordinary rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon for it. And I farther affirme, that Audience being giuen in this maner, things will be carryed more ſmoothly, and with more eaſe on either part; For that which breakes down your <hi>Damn's</hi> in your riuers, is the detention of the water. And the detayning of a Subiect from the preſence &amp; ſpeech of his King, is that which doth diſhearten, and deiect the mindes of your negociants, and ſupplicants. And when they ſee, they ſo ſeldome haue Audience, and are put off from day to day, and that it coſtes them ſo deare before they can be heard, they will, while they may, make vſe of that preſent occaſion, and then they talke world without end, and neuer giue ouer, becauſe they are afraid they ſhall neuer haue the like opportunitie againe. But when thoſe ſuitors ſhall know that they ſhall haue ordinary hearing, on ſuch dayes, and ſuch a ſet houre, and for ſo long a time, they will content themſelues, with giuing much leſſe trouble to their owne tongues, and his Maieſties eares. In a word, no man will denie; but ſay with me, that it is iuſt and meete, That he, that is to rule, and remedy all, ought likewiſe to heare all and that
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:180809:94"/>
all men ſhould know as much; for, for the good, and hope thereof, they principally obay, and loue their King. And beſides, a great part of that concurſe, and tedious trouble of <hi>Negociants,</hi> will by this meane, be cut off. For, vnleſſe it be in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

For it is naturally inbred in all, to feare and reſpect Greatneſſe, And therefore will not cauſe moleſtation to ſo great a Maieſtie but when they cannot finde any other meanes to negociate. In concluſion, facile Audience in Kings, is ſuch a vertue, as doth ſupply (and that with a great deale of aduantage) the defect of many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther vertues. And where there is no neede of that ſupply, it ſerues to giue a greater luſter and perfection to the reſt, the ſubiect not hauing any other thing, that he more craueth from, or deſireth in his King. And queſtionleſſe, vſe and cuſtome, will make it more eaſie, though at firſt it may ſeeme ſomewhat troubleſome vnto him. King <hi>Antigonus,</hi> who was father to the great <hi>Demetrius,</hi> was a proud, ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious, couetous, cruell, and effeminate Prince, and yet not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding all theſe vices, and other his weakeneſſes and infirmities, his ſubiects did beare with them, and did truly ſerue and obay him, becauſe he did neuer refuſe to giue them Audience, gaue them kinde and faire anſweres, ſuffred him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe to bee ſeene often of them, and did neuer ſhew to any man a frowning looke, or diſcontented Countenance.</p>
               <p>This facile giuing of Audience, doth bring likewiſe with it another benefit not ſo well vnderſtood perhaps, as it ought to be, by Kings and their fauourites. Which is; That thereby they receiue the priuate aduertiſements of particular perſons in ſuch a conuenient time and ſeaſon, as is fitting for them. For, in negociating, by retarding this Audience, either the occaſion is ouerſlipt, or he wearyed out, that ſhould ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertiſe: And becauſe the aduertiſer, (as there is great reaſon for it) would be oath that another man ſhould goe away
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:180809:94"/>
with the thankes and gratification, which is due vnto him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe for his care and diligences vſed therein, he will nego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciate it by his owne, rather them anothers meanes, that he may not looſe both his thankes, and his labour. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe many times this Aduertiſer, either dareth not or holdeth it not fit, to truſt a paper therewith or other mens eares, all this may eaſily be excuſed with a facile Audience. King <hi>Aſſuerus,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Eſter 2.11.</note> by knowing in time the treaſon which was plotted againſt him, by <hi>Bigthan</hi> and <hi>Tareſh,</hi> two of his Eunuches, which kept the doore, had his life thereby pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerued. And <hi>Publicola,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Plut. in vitae Publicolae.</note> the <hi>Roman Conſull</hi> ſaued his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, by preuenting in time the conſpiracie of <hi>Tarquinius,</hi> by giuing eaſie acceſſe and Audience to <hi>Vindicius,</hi> an ordinary ſeruing man, who bewrayed vnto him the treaſon of the <hi>Aquilij,</hi> and <hi>Vitellij,</hi> together with <hi>Brutus</hi> his ſonnes. And the like ſucceſſe had <hi>Pelopidas</hi> amongſt the Grecians, (as you may reade in <hi>Plutarke</hi>) where he much recommen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth in either of them, both <hi>Publicola,</hi> and <hi>Pelopidas,</hi> their kinde and courteous vſing of men, when they came to ſpeak with them, and the eaſie and patient eare they had from them. Whereas on the contrary, diuerſe Princes haue vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly ouerthrowen themſelues and their kingdomes by their hardneſſe and harſhneſſe in this kinde, and haue loſt many a great and faire occaſion, becauſe they would not heare, and examine in time thoſe aduertiſements which were giuen them, &amp; recommended to their better conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Laſt of all, admit that this ſhould not be altogether ſo iuſt and conuenient a courſe as I haue here deliuered vnto you, yet notwithſtanding, becauſe all men wiſh &amp; deſire it, my thinks this one conſideration, in all good reaſon of State ſhould ſuffice, to haue it be held, to be both iuſt, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenient. For it is not poſſible that all both good and bad, ſhould erre in this deſire. And I dare be bold to ſay, that all doe hunger and thirſt, cry and dye for this, except it be ſome few who may feather their neſt by the contrary, whoſe thriuing, and increaſe of wealth doth ordinarily conſiſt, in
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:180809:95"/>
clapping a lock on the kings eare, &amp; barring the doore to his hearing, ſo that men can hardly &amp; with a great deale of diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty come to ſpeak vnto him. And beſides the foreſayd be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits, by debarring men of eaſie acceſſe to the king, all requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall of their good ſeruice, either by gracious words, or deedes, is quite taken from them; which certainly is a iewell ſo wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy the wearing, that euery one would willingly haue it for himſelf. And if kings do not know thus much, or that they are not told therof, it is by reaſon of that old miſcheife which they ſuffer by not hearkening vnto truth, either in their Counſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours or thoſe <hi>Auiſos,</hi> that are repreſented vnto them, or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe thoſe that are neere about his Maieſtie &amp; intereſſed in his fauour, will not let him be acquainted with any thing, ſaue what they know wil pleaſe his humour, &amp; giue him moſt co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, till the buſines itſelf breake out, &amp; the errour (like an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſthume) beginns to grow ripe, and the wound (as we ſay) ſhewes it ſelfe; then and neuer till then, is the ſmart of it felt: Which is ill for the kingdom, &amp; worſe for the King. For, in theſe delicts and exceſſes, the King, (in the peoples conceit) ſhal be the only man in fault, &amp; he that muſt pay for all. Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous is the State of Kings, dangerous the times, but more dangerous the remedy, &amp; the non-conueniencie for the now putting it in practiſe. In ordinary, and publick Audiences, let not Kings permit either Miniſters, Counſellours, or Embaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſadors to enter, for it wil but make the Commons complaine, that that is taken away from them, which is theirs; And they on the other ſide, being principall perſons, will mutter and grumble, thinking themſelues wronged, and their worth vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derualewed, to haue all one Audience with the ordinary ſorte of people. So that with one &amp; the ſame Act, he diſcontents all of them. Let there be dayes, &amp; houres, appointed for the one, &amp; the other naturalls, &amp; ſtrangers, &amp; let euery man know his ſet day, and houre. For this being without diſtinction, what doth it ſerue for, but multitude, and confuſion? And to haue all of all ſortes to aſſiſt there continually to heare and nouriſh
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:180809:95"/>
the Complaints of particular perſons, and to make report thereof by Letters to their ſeuerall nations and Countries, and to put a Gloſſe vpon them, to ſhew their owne wit. And though this at the firſt ſight, may ſeeme to be a thing of ſmall importance, yet ſuch a time may be taken, that it may proue a matter of great conſequence.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">K</seg>Ings (ſaith <hi>Xenophon</hi>) haue many eares; For they heare by their owne, and by thoſe of their Fauourites, Miniſters, &amp; Counſellours. And it is no more then they ſtand in neede of. For they muſt heare all, Great, and Small, Naturall, and Stranger, without acceptation of perſons, theſe as well as thoſe; and deny no man their eares, leſt they giue them iuſt cauſe to grieue and complaine, that for them onely, there is neither King, Fauourite, nor Miniſter to haue acceſſe vnto. This <hi>Rapſodye,</hi> and multitude of eares, and the difference between the one and the other, King <hi>Dauid</hi> giues vs to vnderſtand in that his Audience which he crau'd of God. <hi>Domine, Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>audi orationem meam auribus percipe obſecrationem meam.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Pſal. 143.1.</note> Heare my prayer (O Lord) bow downe thine eare, and hearken vnto my ſupplication. He ſaith, Heare me, O Lord; but how, or in what maner? With thine eares, I beſeech thee. Tell me (thou holy king) why doſt thou ſay with thine eares. Might not that phraſe of ſpeech beene ſpared? Or wouldſt thou happely, that God ſhould heare thee with his eyes, or his mouth? No certainly, But becauſe it is a vſuall cuſtome with Kings, that gouerne great Monarchies, who by reaſon of the varietie and multitude of buſineſſes, cannot by them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:180809:96"/>
giue eare vnto all, and informe themſelues of the truth, to remit part of them to others, that they may heare the Parties, and informing themſelues of the buſines, may ſend it afterwards to the <hi>Conſulta</hi> there to be debated. One comes with his Memoriall to the King; The King wills him to ſpeake vnto the Preſident, or to ſuch a Secretary, that he may inform. But <hi>Dauid</hi> here ſaith; Remit me not O Lord vnto any other, for remiſſions, are remiſſions, the very word telling vs, that to remit a buſines, is to make it remiſſe and ſlow, and that there is vſed therein ſo much remiſſion, that a mans life is oftentimes ended, before his buſines. <hi>Auribus percipe:</hi> Doe thou thy ſelfe heare me with thine owne eares, without remitting me to the hearing of others. But to heare all, and in all partes, without remiſſion to other mens eares, who can doe this ſaue onely God? And for my part, I am of opinion, that they alluded vnto this, who (as wee told you) pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted their God without eares; for to giue vs thereby to vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand, that it is peculiar onely vnto God to heare with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out eares, and to heare all, without ſtanding in neede of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Oydos,</hi> or <hi>Oydores;</hi> For ſuch a neceſſitie, were in God a defect. But in Kings it were a defect to doe otherwiſe; for they are notable to heare all of themſelues, and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore muſt of force make vſe of other mens eares. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, as Nature, in Mans body hath diſpoſed different Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, neceſſary for it's proper conſeruation, as the eyes to ſee, the eares to heare, the tongue to talke, the hands to worke, the feete to walke, and all of them to aſſiſt to the Empire of the ſoule. So in like manner, this Myſticall body of the Common-wealth, whereof the King is the ſoule, and Head, muſt haue it's members, which are thoſe his Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, which are Subiect to the Empire of their king, by whom hee diſpoſeth and executeth all that, which doth conuene for it's Gouernment, conſeruation, and augmen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation.<note place="margin">Ariſt. de Anima.</note> 
                  <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> renders the reaſon, why your huge and extraordinary tall men are but weake; And (as I take it) it is
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:180809:96"/>
this. The rationall Soule (ſaith he) is ſolely one, indiuiſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and of a limited vertue or power, and that it cannot at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayne to that ſtrength and force, as to giue vigour to thoſe partes that are ſo farre diſtant and remote in a body, beyond meaſure, great. Now, if the body of this Monarchie, be ſo vaſte, and exceeding great, and goes dayly increaſing more and more, and that the Soule of the King which is to go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerne it, to animate it, and to giue it life, doth not increaſe, nor is multiplyed, nor augmented, at leaſt in it's Miniſters; How is it poſſible, that a King of himſelfe alone ſhould bee able to afford aſſiſtance to all? And to giue life, and being, to ſo many partes and members, that are ſet ſo far aſſunder? ſo great is the Office of a king, eſpecially, if he be Maſter of many Kingdomes, that it is too great a Compaſſe, for one mans reach, and it is not one man alone, that can fill and oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupie a whole Kingdome, and be preſent in all it's partnes. And therefore of force he muſt make vſe of other folkes helpe, and more particularly of thoſe, which ſerue him in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of eares, ſuch as are all your ſuperiour Miniſters of Counſells. Theſe great Officers are called in the Spaniſh, <hi>Oydores,</hi> of <hi>Oyr,</hi> To heare; And the eares of the head, are called <hi>Oydoras,</hi> of their hearing; And your Iudges of the land, <hi>Oydores,</hi> Hearers of Mens cauſes And as they are alike in name, ſo ought they likewiſe to be alike in Office, and to reſemble the Originall, which it repreſenteth, to the life, and it's true nature. Now, what Office is moſt proper and moſt naturall to the eares? you will all grant mee, that it is to heare alwayes, &amp; neuer to be ſhut. Your eyes haue their <hi>port<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cullis,</hi> which they open, or ſhut, as they ſee cauſe. The mouth, hath the like; But the eares (like bountifull houſe keepers) haue their doores ſtill open, and thoſe leafes which they haue on either ſide are neuer ſhut, neuer ſo much as once wagge. And it is <hi>Pliny's</hi> obſeruation; That onely man,<note place="margin">Plin. natur. Hiſt, lib. <hi>2.</hi>

Vnto whom, <hi>Dauid</hi> compares thoſe who being <hi>Oydos del Rey,</hi> the Kings eares, or (to ſpeake in the vſuall phraſe) <hi>Oydores del Reyno,</hi> the Kingdomes eares, doe ſhut and ſtop their eares, that they may not giue due and fitting Audience. Being naturally enemies to their owne profeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which is to heare; ſeeking out ſhiftes and tricks, that the Cryes, and Complaints of the poore may not come to their eares. There is not any crueltie comparable to this, to ſee a poore ſuitor trot vp and downe, a moneth or two together, labouring to haue Audience, and in ſtead of let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting him in, hath the doore ſtill ſhut againſt him. Nature would not allow doores to the eares, &amp; yet theſe that are the Common-wealths eares, make profit of the doores of their houſes, and command them to be kept ſhut: your ſuitors they come and goe, but my <hi>ſennior Oydor,</hi> my Lord iudge, he that ſhould haue his doores open, to giue open hearing to all Comers, is ſhut vp in his cloſet, and cannot be ſpoken withall vnder a couple of Capons. The <hi>Tribunes</hi> of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of <hi>Rome</hi> (a Magiſtracie ordained for defending of the Communaltie) kept their gates ſtill open, that men at all houres, might vpon all occaſions, come and treat with them. If that young man,<note place="margin">Act. 22.21.</note> which was Saint <hi>Pauls</hi> ſiſters ſonne, who heard the Conſpiracie which the Iewes had plotted a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him, and went to giue aduiſe thereof to the Magiſtrate,
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:180809:97"/>
had not found ſuch eaſie entrance into the <hi>Tribunes</hi> houſe as he did, without doubt it had coſt <hi>Paul</hi> his life. For fourty men, had taken a ſolemne oath to kil him as he came forth of priſon to his Triall; and bound themſelues with a curſe, that they would neither eate, not drinke, till they had killed him. Now, when this young man came to the Chiefe Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine, and told him that he had ſomething to ſay vnto him; The Text there ſaith, that the Captaine tooke him by the hand, and went a part with him alone, and asked him; What haſt thou to ſhew to me, &amp;c. With this facilenes, did the Miniſters of that Heathen-people, giue Audience. How much more ought Chriſtian Miniſters to doe the like? The open doore, and the giuing of Audience in ſome open Hall, or in ſome outward Court, whereunto all are admitted to enter, would giue much content vnto many; but theſe cloſe doores, and cloſe Audience, to very few; which is purpoſely done for to pleaſure their friends and ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants; for, from this their hard acceſſe, and difficile en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance, they likewiſe make their gaine, and are not aſhamed now to demand that for a fee, which if they were well ſerued ſhould be recompenced with a halter And looke what I haue ſaid of your <hi>Oydores,</hi> which are your Iudges in Chanceries, and other the chiefe Courtes of Iuſtice; I ſay the like of other Miniſters, who though they haue not the ſame name, yet doe they ſerue as eares to their king. And then are their eares ſhut, and growne deafe, when they will not heare; making thereby his Maieſtie to be found fault withall, &amp; to receiue a hard cenſure from his ſubiects, when he is innocent &amp; blameleſſe, and drawing a thouſand other miſchiefes vpon the Common-wealth. And it is a moſt ſhamefull thing, and worthy reprehenſion, &amp; redreſſe, that when kings ſhall bee liberall in this kind, their Miniſters ſhould be ſo ſhort &amp; cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and that a man ſhould be at more coſt and trouble to get Audience of them, &amp; to negociate a buſines, then of the king himſelf. And the miſchiefe of it is, that they procure and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:180809:98"/>
now, as in former times, the greateſt fauours the higheſt places, honors, &amp; dignities, whilſt in the mean while it is not thought vpon, nor taken into conſideratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that beſides the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence which is done herein vnto God &amp; the Common-wealth, that it is one of the moſt preiudiciall things in the world for the quiet peace of States, &amp; the conſeruation of kingdomes. And this was well vnderſtood by <hi>Abſolon</hi> the ſon of <hi>Dauid,</hi> &amp; pretender to the Crowne of <hi>Iſrael.</hi> Who perceiuing, that the king his father through his great imployments in the Wars, could not ſo well attend his giuing Audience to all his ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects, and that they to whoſe charge &amp; care it was committed, did not cumply, therin with their obligation, he placed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe at the entrance of the Citie, whether the ſuitours repai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, and ſeeing how much they diſtaſted it, that they had not that quicke Audience and diſpatch as they expected, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired, he inſinuates himſelfe into them, and ſpeaking very kindly,<note place="margin">2 Sam. 15.3.</note> and louingly vnto them, he tolde them. <hi>Videntur mihi Sermones tui boni &amp; iuſti, ſed non eſt qui te audiat con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutus à Rege:</hi> Thy matters are good and righteous, but there is no man deputed of the King to heare thee. And this is it, that puts all out of frame, and order. O quoth he, that I were made Iudge in the land, that euery man which hath any matter of controuerſie might come to me, that I might doe him Iuſtice; &amp;c. And it followeth anon after in the Text; <hi>Quod ſolicitabat corda virorum:</hi> That by this means he ſtale away the hearts of the men of <hi>Iſrael.</hi> And that thereupon there ſhortly after inſued a great rebellion, which put the king, &amp; the kingdom in great ieopardie. Which may ſerue as a leſſon for a good Miniſter, to teach them what they ought to do, &amp; not to think, they do that which they ought, when for faſhion ſake, they giue ſhort and crowding Audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences, where that which enters in at one eare, goes out (as they ſay) at another. But that ſo much time ſhould be allowed for the hearing of them, as the qualitie off the buſines ſhall require, without cutting thoſe off, who go rendring their rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons;
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:180809:98"/>
For he that hath not the patience to heare them, either he not vnderſtandeth them, or is afraid to meddle with them.</p>
               <p>With this therefore I conclude this, and the former diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe. That the firſt Office of a King, is, To heare all his ſubiects. And it being ſuppoſed, that he alone cannot doe it, it is fit he ſhould haue <hi>Oydores,</hi> that ſhould heare for him, and be his eares. And for that as by the eares of the head, there runn's along a certaine ſecret nerue, by meanes wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of that which is heard, is preſently conuaied to the braine, there to be regiſtred, and conſulted on by the Common ſenſe. So theſe <hi>Oydores,</hi> ought to holde their ſecret <hi>Conſulta,</hi> wherein they ought to make relation vnto the King of all that they haue heard. But let them weigh with all, what a ſhort Cut it is from the eare to the braine, and the ſmall ſtay that is made in this Iourney, or paſſage; to the end that by this natural courſe, which is ſo quicke, &amp; ſpeedy, they may ſee their errour, and perceiue what a great fault it is, to retarde their <hi>Conſultations,</hi> to ſhew themſelues thicke of hearing, &amp; to haue their eares ſhut, or rather the <hi>Oydores</hi> themſelues ſhut vp, and not to be ſpoken withall. Some would faine excuſe theſe Audiences, with the impertinencies of thoſe that craue them, which ſometimes are very large and tedious and to as little purpoſe, as they are too too importune, &amp; vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſonable. But to this anſwere; That your high and emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent places, bring with them this trouble and charge; And (as the Apoſtle Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſaid) that it is a great token of prudence to know how to beare with the fooliſh, and to haue ſuffrance and patience with thoſe, that are none of the wiſeſt. <hi>Libenter enim ſuffertis inſipientes,</hi>

And becauſe he that is moſt wiſe, is moſt offended with ignorance, let him know, that he meriteth much in diſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling it, when it is fitting ſo to doe: for to ſay the truth (as the ſame Apoſtle affirmeth, Gods good and faithfull Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters haue obligation, both to the Wiſe, and to the fooliſh.

And in the third booke of the Kings, God
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:180809:101"/>
being willing to grace and autorize the perſon of <hi>Salomon,</hi> who was the Type &amp; figure of the true King of Kings, our Sauiour Ieſus Chriſt, had no ſoner the Crowne ſet on his head, &amp; the poſſeſſion of the Kingdom ſettled vpon him, but there was preſently offred and put into his hands a great occaſion for to ſhew his prudence and wiſedome, and his great nobleneſſe and courage for to do iuſtice. The Caſe was a common and knowen Caſe; it was betwixt two women, that were friends and Companions, who leading a lewd and diſhoneſt life, were deliuered or brought to bed both at one time, and ſleeping together in one bed, the one of them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing oppreſſed with a heauie ſleepe, ouer-layd her childe, and when ſhe awaked, ſhee found it to be dead. And at the ſame inſtant, without being felt, or perceiued bv her Compani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, ſhe puts me the dead childe by her, and tooke the liuing childe to her ſelfe. But this theft could not be ſo couered, for all her cunning carriage, but that the other knew, that the dead childe which was layd by her ſide, was not hers, but the liuing. The other with a great deale of impudencie, and diſſimulation deny'de it. And becauſe they could not agree vpon the buſines, they reſolued to goe to King <hi>Salomon</hi> before whom the buſines was continued with the like ſtiffeneſſe, and obſtinate conteſtation, giuing each other the Lye, and other the like bold and vnciuill ſpeeches as is vſuall with ſuch kinde of women. The King, finding no more proofe nor reaſon of credit in the one, then the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, commanded a caruing Knife to be brought into the open Courte, &amp; that diuiding the liuing childe in the middſt, the one halfe ſhould be giuen to the one, and the other to the other. Thereupon, the true Mother, trembling and quaking, and feeling that knife already in her owne bowels, which was to part her childe in twaine, beſought the King, that this his ſentence might not be executed, but that the childe might be deliuered ouer whole to the other. Which being well weigh'd and conſidered by this wiſe King, and good
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:180809:101"/>
Iuſticer, he knew thereby, that ſhe was the true Mother and ſo gaue order, that the childe ſhould be reſtored vnto her. And the holy Scripture ſaith; That the ſame of this notable peece of Iuſtice was divulged farre and neere, and that there grew thence a great reſpect in all the people of <hi>Iſrael</hi> towards this their moſt prudent King, who had with ſo much iudgement and wiſedome, adminiſtred Iuſtice. <hi>Audiait itaque omnis Iſrael iudicium, quod iudicaſſet Rex,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">3. King. 3.28.</note>

So that, when they ſaw how iuſt a King he was, and with what a deale of vprightnes, he did admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter Iuſtice, the people ſhouted for ioy, and cryed out, that his wiſdome was from heauen, and though he were then very young, they began to feare and reuerence him very much. And therefore if a king will be beloued, eſteemed, and reſpected of his ſubiects, he muſt be a iuſt King. For, moſt certaine it is, that if Kings will pretend honour, au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie, credit, eſtimation, and reſpect, they cannot take any better courſe for it, then by giuing to euery one, that which appertaineth vnto him, with a iuſt hand. <hi>Summum in regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus bonum eſt</hi> (ſaith Saint <hi>Gregory) iuſtitiam colere,</hi>

And there is not any Title more honourable, or that doth ſo <hi>quadrare,</hi> ſo ſquare; and ſute; with a King, as that of luſt. whereby a King is made as it were a God vpon earth, and becomes like vnto him in rewarding, and puniſhing. <hi>Anaxagoras,</hi> and <hi>Homer,</hi> called Kings, <hi>Iovis diſcipulos, Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piters Schollers;</hi> becauſe in imitation of the Gods, they did adminiſter Iuſtice.

This is the thing (ſaith <hi>Oſorrus</hi>) that Kings muſt looke vnto;<note place="margin">Oſor: lib <hi>4</hi> de reg.

<pb n="183" facs="tcp:180809:102"/>
that vphodeth Kingdomes, without which they cannot long laſt and continue. For God will moſt iuſtly puniſh them, by taking thoſe from them, which they haue, if they diſſimulate iniuſtices, and if they ſuffer themſelues to be carryed away contrary to all right and reaſon, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit notorious faults to paſſe without puniſhment: Other faults are not ſo much riſented in Kings, and Kingdomes are content to tolerate them, be they neuer ſo great. But ſhould they haue neuer ſo many other good partes, if they be faulty in this, which is of ſo great importance, they ſhall preſently ſee and perceiue a publicke face of ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, and a generall diſcontent in all their ſubiects. And God oftentimes, makes it a meanes for the puniſhment, and amendment of Kings and Kingdomes. It is the ſaying of <hi>Ieſus</hi> the ſonne of <hi>Syrach;</hi> That by Counſaile,<note place="margin">Eccl. 10.8.</note> and Iuſtice, Kingdomes are maintained.

Which (as <hi>Diuus Thomas</hi> ſaith) are the <hi>partes Subiectiuae</hi> or ſubiectiue parts of this Iuſtice; that is to ſay, it's eſſential Species. And therfore we will treate of theſe two, and that very briefly. And firſt in the firſt place of the Commutatiue, and in the ſecond of the diſtributiue.</p>
               <p>Iuſtice Commutatiue, Contractiue, or Venditiue, (for all theſe names your Authors giue it, for the matter of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mutations,<note place="margin">Ariſt. <hi>10.</hi> Met: Tit. <hi>18.</hi>
                  </note> Contracts and Sales, wherein it is exerciſed, is conſidered betwixt two, party and party, which are a part of that whole body of the Common-wealth, which giue, and take, betweene themſelues, by way of Contract, or Sale. It's end, and obiect, is equalitie, and proportion, betweene that, which is giuen; and that, which is receiued; with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out reſpect vnto the perſons which buy, and ſell, but to that
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:180809:106"/>
which is contracted, ſolde, or commutated, that there may be an equalitie and proportion had, betwixt that, which is giuen, and taken. And when in this there is a defection, it is contrary to Commutatiue Iuſtice. The diſtributiue, is conſidered betweene the whole, and it's parts. The. <hi>Medium</hi> of this Vertue, doth not conſiſt in the equaltie of thing to thing, but of the things to the perſons; for, as one perſon ſurpaſſeth another, ſo the thing, which is giuen to ſuch a perſon, exceedeth that part, which is giuen to another per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon. So that there is an equalitie of proportion betweene that, which is more, and that which is leſſe; but not an equalitie of quantitie, to wit; So much to the one, as to the other. For thoſe, which in a Common-wealth, are not e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quall in dignitie, and deſert, ought not equally to enioy the Common goods thereof, when they are reparted and diuided by the hand of diſtributiue Iuſtice; As we ſhall ſhew you by and by, when we come to ſpeake of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mutatiue, which treates of equalizing and according that, which mens diſordinate appetites, and boundleſſe couetouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe doth diſconcerte, and put out of order, euery one being deſirous to vſurpe that for himſelfe, which of right appertaines, and belongs to another, whence ariſe your coſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nages and deceits in humane Contracts, and whence doe reſulte thoſe contentions, diſſenſions, and ſutes in Law.

Iuſtice obligeth not to giue them more then their ordinary pay, yet in a iuſt gratification, it is required of Kings, that they ſhould reward and honour them; according to the qualitie of their perſons, and ſeruices.

And by how much the greater the good is, by ſo much with the greater force doth it communicate it ſelfe. And hence doth it come to paſſe, that God is ſo liberall and ſo exceeding bountifull as he is (that I may not ſay prodigall) with men, by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municating himſelfe vnto them by all poſſible meanes, euen to the communicating of himſelfe by that moſt excellent and higheſt kinde of manner, that he could poſſible deuiſe, which was, by giuing himſelfe to himſelfe, and by ſubmit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting himſelfe ſo low as to become true man, that man might be exalted ſo high, as to be made equall with God, by that ineffable and diuine vnion, which the Diuines call <hi>Hypoſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticall.</hi> So that you ſee, that Good, in its owne condition &amp; nature, hath this propertie with it to be communicable, &amp; by ſo much the more, by how much the more great it is.

Now, for to temper and moderate this generall longing, and inflamed deſire, &amp; this ſo naturall and proper and appetite, of beſtowing and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiding the riches, and common goods of the Common-wealth, this part of Iuſtice, which they call Diſtributiue was held the moſt neceſſary. Which <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> ſays, either is, or ought to be in a King, as in ſuch a Lordly ſubiect, and perſon, to whom this repartition and communicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, properly belongeth.

<pb n="201" facs="tcp:180809:111"/>
                  <hi>Arborem, quam vidiſti<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> tu es Rex.</hi> The tree that thou ſaweſt, is thou, O King. That tree, was an expreſſe ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nification, of that King, and of the Vaſtnes and greatneſſe of his Monarchie, and of that which conueneth, and is proper to ſuch Monarckes. Which is: To communicate their fruit to all, To ſuſtaine and maintaine their ſubiects, and to hugg, and defend them vnder the ſhadow of their wings; And this is ſaid to haue beene, and to haue conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neued with that Monarke; whileſt the tree ſtood whole and ſound: But the Dreame, and it's declaration, proceeded far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and <hi>Daniel</hi> told the King; That after he had ſeene the beautie and greatneſſe of that tree, he heard likewiſe a moſt ſtrong and fearefull voyce from Heauen, pronouncing a moſt heauie and rigorous ſentence, that the tree ſhould be hewen downe, and the boughes lopt off, and ſo wholy and vtter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly deſtroyed, that the creatures that came thither and were fed and maintayned by it's fruit, fled thence, and forſooke it. Yet the ſtump of the rootes thereof was left in the earth, and bound about with a bond of braſſe, and yron, &amp;c. In this dreame, were ſignified three things, declared by the ſelfe ſame Prophet, with the ſame Spirit of God. Firſt, The fall of that King and Kingdome, in thoſe lopt boughes, and the hewing of it downe, and leauing it fruitleſſe; Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, That which vſually befalls Kings, who not hauing wherewithall to giue, all thoſe doe leaue and forſake him, which before did follow him. Thirdly, That when the rootes remaine, there is hope that it may be reſtored, and returne to its former greatneſſe: As was to be ſeene in this King, whom God ſo ſeuerely puniſhed for his ſinnes. For the rootes of the ſaid tree remained ſtill whole and ſound, and were a moſt certaine prognoſtication, and aſſured hope, that hee was to be reſtored to his former Eſtate. So that when in Kingdomes, the <hi>Rayzes</hi> of the rents royall, remaine whole and intire, though in the giuing away of the fruites<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> there be much bounty and liberalitie vſed, thoſe breaches
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:180809:112"/>
may be made vp againe, which are occaſioned by ſo large a hand; But when the <hi>rayzes</hi> are grub'd vp, when the roote that ſhould giue ſap and life, is gone, there is not any means of reſtauration to be made or found, though Kings ſhould charge their Kingdomes with neuer ſuch exceſſiue tributes, and draw (as they ſay) the very heart blood from forth their ſubiects bodies. In a word therefore, there ought to be had in giuing<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Order, Moderation, and Temperance; For a Prince, that giues without theſe conditions, is not Liberall, but Prodigall, a great ſcatterer and waſter, and if not contenting himſelfe with the fruites of the tree, he will haue a pull at the rootes, Lord haue mercy on that Land, for it is to be feared, that King will turne Deſtroyer. Giuing hath it's times, it's taxe, it's <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>umes, and it's orderly maner in the doing thereof. The exceſſe whereof, doth croſſe and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradict diſtributiue Iuſtice. Wherein is to be conſidered the kings abilitie; then the ſeruices and merits of the perſons; and laſt of all the Diſtribution it ſelfe, which muſt be done with diſcretion and prudence. For all muſt not be throwen vpon one either part, or partie; nor kings be like riuers; which riſing out of their bedds, breaking forth beyond their bounds, vndoe ſome, and enrich others; robbing many, to raiſe one. God free euery good Common-wealth from ſuch diſtributions as theſe, which are rather deſtructions then diſtributions, and actions of Iniuſtice, not of Iuſtice. And God (I beſeech him) ſo illighten the vnderſtanding and heartes of Kings, that they may in an orderly kinde of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner conferre their fauours, and giue rather reaſonable re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards to many, then extrauagant ones to a few. For the raine doth then moſt good, when all haue the comfort of it. But when it powres downe in one place alone, that marrs and ſpoyles all. Some grounds for want thereof are parched and dryed vp; and other ſome, by too much, are ouerflowen, and made fruitleſſe. In like manner a King, ſhowring downe all the water of his liberalitie vpon one
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:180809:112"/>
particular perſon, it cannot but breede a generall diſcontent and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>anguiſhment, in all the reſt of his ſubiects. And more is the hurt, which reſulteth from thoſe, that are offended with the great fauours conferred on others, then the good that ariſeth from thoſe that are benefited by them. For the firſt neuer forget the wrong they thinke they haue receiued; And the ſecond treate of that they haue receiued, as of a due debt. And all theſe, and a great many more inconueni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences grow from the not true obſeruing of this diſtributiue Iuſtice. Let Kings conferre fauours on their publicke Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, and vpon ſuch perſons, as haue done them great and notable ſeruices, both in Peace, and in Warre: for this will be well pleaſing, and very acceptable vnto all, and will ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lige them all to new ſeruices; And ſuch a generall content will it cauſe in all ſortes of people, that it will make them to brook with the better patience thoſe great fauours, which are vndeſeruedly done vnto others, being in themſelues men of no merit in the world<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I would not haue Kings to be too much carried away with the inclination of their own mindes, for as they are Kings, they will euermore be apt to giue much. But I would haue them to place their eyes, as alſo their conſideration, vpon the qualitie of the perſon, to whom they giue, according to the rules of Diſtributiue Iuſtice. For from that in the receiuer, and this in the Giuer, is formed that Temperance, Moderation, and Equitie, which giues li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berality it's being, and makes it to be a vertue Heroicall, and worthy Kings; Which, if it be fayling in ether of theſe, the one, or the other, it ſhall merit no ſuch name; as you ſhall ſee by and by, when we come to conclude this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe; wherein we aduertiſe thoſe that giue, that it ſhall be much prudence, and make likewiſe much for the good of the party himſelfe, that receiueth, to goe leyſurely along with him in theſe <hi>Mercedes,</hi> and fauours. For this difference<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I finde to be betweene offences, and puniſhments, fauours, and benefits, that the firſt are done but once, becauſe in diſcretion
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:180809:113"/>
they will not goe dayly nouriſhing the paſſion of thoſe who receiue the harme thereby, and ſtand in feare leſt the like ill might happen vnto them ſelues. As for the ſecond, it is fitting that they be done often, giuing now a little, and then a little, that it may the better penetrate the palate, and pleaſe the taſte of him that receiueth them; As in our bodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly meates<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and drinkes, bit after bit, &amp; draught after draught, agrees better with our health, and taſte, then groſſe feeding and fall cups.

               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">N</seg>Ow I ſee the reply, and the Argument, which may be made againſt that, which we haue mentioned in the former Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. For this ſame ſiſing of Kings fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uours, and theſe ſame ſhort bounds of bounty, wherein ſome would ſhut them vp, ſeemeth no way compatible with the authoritie and greatneſſe of Kings; Eſpecially on ſuch occaſions, wherein they are forced to beſtow them vpon perſons that are deſeruingly qualified for them, and that haue done notable ſeruices, who are not to be gratified with ſmall gifts; nor may that ſeeme to bee much, which is giuen but once. Firſt of all I anſwer here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto, that it ſtands with good reaſon, that they, who haue ſpent their meanes, and the better and greater part of their liues, in the ſeruice of their King and Common-wealth,
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:180809:113"/>
ſhould be recompenſed according to the qualitie of their perſons and ſeruices, when Kings are well able to doe it, without putting themſelues in neceſſitie, or charging their ſubiects (which they too vſually doe) with extraordinary Impoſitions. And if it be well conſidered, the maine drift of our former Chapter was, that things might be ſo or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred, that Kings might haue wherewithall to giue vpon ſuch like occaſions. That therefore which I ſay, is this; That they ought to holde their hand in thoſe Gifts, which they giue meerely vpon their owne pleaſure and humour, that they may the better cumply with thoſe which lye vpon them by way of obligation. For they, that haue vnder their charge and Command ſuch a multitude and number of ſubiects, it is not meete, that they ſhould conferre many and great fauours vpon a few, and few or none vpon many; ſhewing grace vnto ſome with that, which in Iuſtice is due vnto others, whoſe often ſweats, perpetuall labour, and extreame neede, ſerue now for riches, <hi>regalos,</hi> intertainments, and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuall rents to thoſe, who in all the whole courſe of their life, neuer knew what it was to moyle and toyle, or to take any paines for the Common-wealth.

My anſwer vnto him is; That nothing better be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commeth Kings, for the conſeruing of their Greatneſſe, then to know that they are but men, and that they cannot ſtand in Competition with God, whoſe fountaine of riches, is infinite, and is able to fill and ſatisfie all, and neuer can be drawne dry, though it be imparted and diſtributed to neuer ſo many. Whereas that of men, is but like vnto the water of a Ciſterne, which by being communicated to many is diminiſhed and exhauſted. King <hi>Nabucodonoſor,</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Kings (of whoſe falls, there is mention made in the Scripture) for default of this knowledg, fel from their eſtates: And let that tree, whoſe top touched heauen, and whoſe boughes did ouerſpread the whole world (whereof wee ſo lately made mention) ſerue now the ſecond time for an Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, which going about to imbrace all in it's owne armes, and to giue ſuſtenance in aboundance to all, and pretending to exalt it ſelfe as high as heauen, did pay the price of this it's pride, autoritie, and <hi>Signorie:</hi> and did ſo farre pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoke Gods anger againſt it, that hee commanded it to bee hewen down, &amp; that being layd leuell with the earth, it might

               <p>Moreouer Kings are to conſider that they, who at one clap receiue much from them, grow ſo fat and purſie, that they are not able to ſerue and follow them as they were wont, and ſometimes they retire themſelues, and nere returne againe, to ſee either King or Court, vnleſſe meere Couetouſneſſe, and greedineſſe of gaine draw them thither to beg, more and more,<note place="margin">Gen. 8.7.</note> &amp; to cramme their purſes. Being like vnto that Crowe which <hi>Noah</hi> ſent out of the Arke, who as ſoone as he had found firme footing, and whereon to feede his fill, neuer came back again. Kings Palaces are like <hi>Noahs</hi> Arke, where there is a great diuerſitie in the Conditions of men; and generally you ſhall meete there with more Crowes, then Doues. And here, I will with your good leaue, take a little libertie, to diuert my ſelfe from the Teſtimonies of Holy Scripture, to thoſe of Great Kings and Monarckes, ſome of one nation, and ſome of another. And the firſt, that I ſhall begin withall, ſhall be king <hi>Don Alonſo</hi> of <hi>Sicily,</hi> who
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:180809:115"/>
walking along by the Sea-ſide, cauſed many gobbets of fleſh, ſome great, and ſome ſmall, mingled one amongſt an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other to be brought vnto him, and ſtill as the Crowes (which were many) came about him, to ſome hee threw out the leſſer, to other the larger morſells. Thoſe that went away with the great gobbets, came no more in ſight, but fled their way; but thoſe that had but a ſmall pittance, and were not ſo full gorged, they followed the King whether ſo euer he went, and neuer forſooke him. Who tolde thoſe that were then about him; In this (my Maſters) yee may ſee, how much it importeth Kings to diſtribute their fauours with moderation and temper. <hi>Philip</hi> King of <hi>Macedon,</hi> did much reprehend his ſonne <hi>Alexander</hi> for being too lauiſh of his fauours, and too exceſſiue in his giftes. Telling him, that thereby hee peruerted the mindes of thoſe, that were to ſerue him, who in ſtead of ſeruing him with that loue &amp; loyalty which in duty they were bound vnto, they would now onely ſerue him for their owne particular intereſt, and proper commoditie making, by this meanes, affection and fidelitie become a kinde of trading, and merchandizing. And certainely ſo it is, that when mens mindes make in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt their Aime, and daily to get more and more, they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come ſaleable, and tender their ſeruice to thoſe, that wil giue them moſt. And they, which doe thus accuſtome themſelues to craue and take, the loue of friendſhip and that thanke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full acknowledgement, which is due to the Doner, is turned into intereſſed Loue; which is called by the name of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupiſence, And are (as the Comicke Poet ſaith) like vnto thoſe lewd huſwifes which, <hi>Amore carent, munus amantis amant;</hi> Loue not ſo much the man, as his money, nor his perſon, as his purſe. You ſhall ſeldome ſee a man, that is (as they ſay) a <hi>Pediguenno,</hi> a crauing Companion, one that is ſtill begging one thing or other, that hath not ſome touch of Couetouſneſſe, and ſome tincture more or leſſe of vnthanke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fullneſſe. For, in regard that theſe men loue themſelues, and
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:180809:116"/>
their owne intereſt ſo well, they haue not one drop of loue left for others, and if any doe remaine, they conferre it on a third perſon, through whoſe hands, that which they pretend is to paſſe. And the King, and Prince, to whom all is due, reſt depriued of two things, that are the moſt ſubſtantiall and of moſt importance for the conſeruation, perpetuation, and augmentation of his Kingdome, which are their ſubiects Loue, and Thankes. For the trueſt kinde of Raigning and the likeſt to Gods kingdome, is to gaine the heartes of their ſubiects, and to make themſelues (as much as in them lyes) Lordes and Maſters of their good Wills. And it is our dayly experience, to ſee perſons that haue beene highly and richly gratified, and extraordinarily well rewarded<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to haue proud very vnthankfull. For, this fault great benefits haue with them, and ſuch as are diſ-equall to the deſerts of thoſe perſons that receiue them, that they are not thankfully accepted of; And thoſe that are benefitted, to the end that they may not bewray this their imperfection (being ſuch, as it is no leſſe, then ſo great a ſinne, as ingratitude) they ſoone learne to forget them; but thoſe that are confer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red on others, neuer ſlip out of their remembrance. In a word, of all that that is begg'd, and of all them that begg, few there are, that forbeare to goe this way. In confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion whereof, we may alleadge heere that queſtion, which Chriſt made to one of thoſe ten Leapers which hee healed, ſhewing himſelfe not halfe well pleaſed with the reſt of his fellowes. <hi>Nonne decem mundati ſunt, Et nouem vbi ſunt?

the fauours that are done them, bee they neuer ſo great: They are alwayes crauing, but are neuer ſatisfied; they ſwallow downe whole riuers, and wonder not at it; they thinke all <hi>Iordan</hi> is too little for them, and that they ſhall no ſoner open their mouth; but they muſt preſently ſup it vp. And the reaſon hereof, is; becauſe they verily perſwade themſelues, that all whatſoeuer you giue them, (be it neuer ſo much) is due vnto them for their ſeruices, and their day<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Aſſiſtencies. I therefore ſay, (and therein ſay but the truth,) That one of the greateſt happineſſes, that can befall Kings, is; to be ſerued by noble perſons, and men of honour <hi>gente granada</hi> (as the Spaniards tearme them) iolly, ſtrong, luſty people, proper, comely men, and perſons of beſt and moſt account both for riches and honour. But this is the miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheife of it, that this golde, which ſhould make ſuch a glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous ſhew in Court, and ſhine both in honour and goodneſſe, is canckred and ruſted by Auarice and Ambition, which eates into all mens mindes, and wholly poſſeſſeth them. So that from the higheſt to the loweſt, they are all well read in the Schoole of Couetouſneſſe, Diſſimulation, and deceit; And your Prieſts, and thoſe that weare Miters on their heads, are not in this kinde the meaneſt Schollers amongſt them. All complaine, they are not rewarded, that they haue nothing giuen them, &amp; if they haue any thing giuen them they thinke it is all too litle. And betwixt this their complayning, &amp; their thankefull acceptance, there is ſet vp ſuch a ſtrong partition, that it neither ſuffereth them to acknowledge a benefit, nor to intertaine it with that thankfullneſſe as they ought. All now a dayes attend their own intereſt, and not their kings ſeruice; Who may ſay that of them, which God ſpake by <hi>Malachie;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Malach. 1.10.</note> Who is there euen among you, that would ſhut the doores of my houſe, or kindle but a coale on mine Altar in vaine?

Miſerable is the condition of kings, whom none loue for themſelues but for their owne ends, and the good they expect from them; ſo that this their priuate intereſt fayling them, their ſeruices faile with it, &amp; likewiſe faileth (ſo ſays S. <hi>Iſidore</hi>) that loue &amp; Loy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alty which is due vnto them, <hi>Non ſunt fideles, quos munus, non gratia copulat, nam citò deſerunt, niſi ſemper accipiant;</hi> Thoſe whom Lucre, not Loue linketh, cannot bee faithfull. For vnleſſe they be ſtill on the taking hand, they vaniſh, and are quickly gone<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Yet is it not my intent and purpoſe in that which I haue ſayd, to condemne thoſe who demaund their pay and ſatisfaction for their ſeruices, to relieue their ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſities. For therein they doe but vſe that lawfull courſe which is appointed for them by way of petition. Howbeit, <hi>Ariſtotle, Plato,</hi> and other Philoſophers, would haue ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects to be ſolicitous not in ſueing, but in ſeruing. And I far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther affirme, that Princes are to take it to their charge, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent thoſe that haue done them good ſeruice; it being the principall Office of diſtributiue Iuſtice, carefully &amp; vigilant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to diſtribute riches and honours, to thoſe that haue de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerued them. And this vndoubtedly, is one of the moſt ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectuall meanes for the good gouernment of a Common-wealth; For, as thoſe three diuine vertues, <hi>Faith, Hope,</hi> and <hi>Loue,</hi> are increaſed and augmented by praying vnto God; ſo on the contrarie, are they leſſned and diminiſhed by ſueing vnto Men. For when ſubiects ſerue, and not ſueing obtaine that which they deſerue, humane Faith, Hope, and Loue, is augmented in them; becauſe thereby, they are taught to rely on the vertue and wiſedome of their Soue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne, who applyes himſelfe to euery mans meritts, and the iuſtneſſe and vprightneſſe of his cauſe; For which cauſe they will loue him much, but much more, when he giues without being importuned with petitions. And it ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meeth vnto them that hee giues not more willingly, then
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:180809:117"/>
he doth wiſely, in applying himſelfe onely to reaſon and Iuſtice, and not to the importunate Petitions of Pretenders. And therefore Kings are not to content themſelues onely with paying that which they owe, and to doe <hi>mercedes</hi> and fauours to them that ſerue them; but that theſe ſhould like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe goe accompanied with Loue and Good Will; for with remuneration are the ſeruices requited; and with Loue, are they obliged to doe them ſtill more and better ſeruice. In that Caſe, which the Scripture recounteth of King <hi>Aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erus,</hi> who, one night being not able to ſleep and take his reſt, commanded Lights to be brought in, and ſome that were about him, to take that booke, and read vnto him, wherein were written the notable things that paſt in his raigne, and amongſt the reſt, there was mention made of a great peece of ſeruice, which <hi>Mardochee</hi> did him, freeing him from that death, which two of his Eunuches had plotted againſt him, by diſcouering this their treaſon, demanded of thoſe there preſent; What honour and dignitie hath beene giuen to <hi>Mordochee</hi> for this his fidelitie towards me, and the good ſeruice he hath done mee? And the Kings ſeruants that miniſtred vnto him, ſayd; There is nothing done for him. Whereupon, he preſently beſtowed vpon him ſuch great ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nors and dignities, that vnleſſe he ſhould haue giuen him his kingdome, he could not well haue giuen him more. Thus was this good ſeruant rewarded, honoured, and graced by his Lord and Maſter, who without being importuned, gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiouſly called his good ſeruices to remembrance, and honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red him aboue all the Princes of his Kingdome. And I could wiſh, that all that are rewarded by their Kings, might receiue their recompence vpon the like good tearmes of Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and Iuſtice. But now a dayes, poore and ſlender ſeruices (the more is the pitie) finde copious, and plentifull rewards; and thoſe (ordinarily) accompanied with ingratitude; A thing, which Nature it ſelfe abhorreth; And which tyes Gods hands from giuing, who is ſo liberall and ſo rich; and

But when hee found hee could hardly goe in it, and that he had not the free libertie and command of his body, hee ſayd vnto the King;<note place="margin">1. Kings. 17.29.</note> 
                  <hi>Non poſſum ſic incedere, quia non vſum habeo:</hi> I cannot goe with theſe; for I am not accumſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med.

And heere will I bring to their remembrance, that which God did, when that famous and ancient Tabernacle was to be built,<note place="margin">Exod. 31.4.</note> which was to be a figure of his holy Church. Who (as the Scripture tells vs) nominated <hi>Bezaleel</hi> a cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious workeman in all manner of workemanſhip, whom he filled with his holy Spirit, and indewed him with wiſedome and knowledge from heauen, that hee might finiſh that worke, and bring it to perfection, God himſelfe hauing drawen the plot, and being the chiefe, and principall Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triuer thereof. And if for that dead Edifice, for which hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane skill and dexteritie might ſeeme to haue beene ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, there was made choice of a man of ſuch ſingular wiſedome, and ſuch admirable partes, as is there mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in <hi>Exodus;</hi> for the gouernment of a kingdome, for the ordring of a Common-wealth, for to put euery thing in it's right place, and to adminiſter Iuſtice equally to all, giuing euery one that which is his; things all of them of ſuch great importance, and which doe ſo much beautifie and grace this myſticall body of the Church, what miniſters will it bee neceſſary, that Kings ſhould ſeeke out and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire after? Namely Men, that are full of the ſpirit of God, wiſe vnderſtanding men, good Chriſtians, and adorned with all manner of Vertues. And if they will not beleeue me, let them looke vpon that firſt Election, which the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles made, when <hi>Iudas</hi> turned <hi>Apoſtata,</hi> deſpayr'd, and
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:180809:119"/>

For they, who being ſtill in our eye, diſcouer no faultes, it may be preſumed, that they haue not any; For if they had, in ſuch perſons they would hardly be hid. And let this be exemplified in ſome, nay many of thoſe your pictures which being beheld a farre off ſeeme to be curious peeces, but drawing neere vnto them, appeare to be but courſe worke, and diſcouer great faultes. And therefore <hi>Diogenes</hi> ſayd,<note place="margin">Prou. 17.2<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

For by a mans ſilent reſeruedneſſe, and holding his peace, it is not much, if he paſſe for a wiſe man; becauſe the Holy-Ghoſt ſaith; <hi>Stultus quoque ſi tacuerit, ſapiens reputabitur:</hi> Euen a foole, when he holdeth his peace, is counted wiſe. In like manner, may he ſeeme to be a good Man, that is a great way from vs, becauſe we neither ſee his deedes, nor heare his words. And peraduenture, for this reaſon it was ordayned, that the Pope could not be choſen, vnleſſe he had beene one of the number and fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of thoſe Cardinalls there preſent at the time of the Election. And when kings, cannot meete with ſufficient per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons amongſt thoſe whom they know, they muſt looke o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:180809:120"/>
out, though they bee farther off. For ſo did the wiſeſt King that euer was, King <hi>Salomon;</hi> who vſed dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gences out of his owne Kingdome, for to ſeeke out the beſt Artificers, and ſuch as were the fitteſt and ableſt men for the building of the Temple. He could not content him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe with good workemen onely, but he ſought out thoſe likewiſe, that were the beſt, and the worthieſt. The like courſe ought Kings to take; who alwayes, in thoſe Electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons that they make, for the building and vpholding of this Edifice of the Church, ſhould not content themſelues with electing onely thoſe that are good, but in ſeeking out the beſt and the worthieſt. Whereby their Conſcience ſhall reſt the more ſecure, and freer from opinion. Whereas in doing the contrary, thoſe that are the wiſeſt, and the moſt learned, affirme; That their Conſcience is not onely charged therewith but that they are likewiſe bound to the reſtitution of the robbery, that is therein done to the Church. And it is a lamentable thing, that for to plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure a priuate ſubiect, that he may eate and drinke his fill, and triumph in his pleaſures, a King ſhould put himſelfe in hazard of going to Hell. But aboue all the foreſayd diligences, Kings ought to haue recourſe vnto Prayers &amp; ſupplications, beſeeching Almightie God that he will illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate their vnderſtandings that they may elect the beſt. For ſo did the Apoſtles; who being to picke out two of of the beſt out of the whole pack of thoſe that were there, at the time, when they were to proceede to the Election, they betooke themſelues to prayer, vttering theſe words ſo full of meekeneſſe and humilitie; <hi>Tu domine, qui noſti corda omnium,</hi>

               <p>This, which we haue ſaid touching prouiſion of thoſe that are knowen in Court, it ſeemeth, that it may open a gap for thoſe that are tumultuous Pretenders, and ambiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Courtiers, to carry all before them, and let nothing that falls, ſcape their fingers. For theſe are much better knowen, then thoſe wiſe and vertuous men, who ordinari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly liue retyred, and attend more to the Complying with obligations of their profeſſion, and function, then to the Compliments of thoſe, who ſpend their whole life in pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſions. And it hapneth not once, nor twice, but dayly, and ordinarily, that they who follow the Court, and frequent Princes Pallaces, haue not ſo much followed their ſtudies, and frequented the ſchooles. And few there are of them, which take pleaſure in reading of bookes, to informe their knowledge, and to ſupply that, which is defectiue in them, concerning the knowledge of buſineſſes, and the true vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding and execution of their Offices. But the miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie of it is, that if a wiſe and prudent Man ſhall ſeeke to make his entrance and acceſſe to the King, the Porters will ſhut the doore againſt him. And fooles hauing ſuch free entrance it is no wonder that wiſe men are kept out. As it hapned to that wiſe Philoſopher who being clad in a meane but honeſt habit, preſſed amongſt the reſt to the Kings <hi>Ante<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>camera,</hi> or with-drawing Chamber, where hee vſed to giue Audience, hauing very neceſſary occaſion to ſpeake vnto him.

To this point therfore I reply, that thoſe men, which are to be nominated for Offices, and Dignities, may be knowen two manner of wayes; Firſt, by that good fame and report which goes of them, and that opinion of vertue, learning, and wiſedome, which the world holdeth of them.

of his Vertue, Holineſſe, and Learning (which is as Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſays of himſelfe, and his fellow Labourers,<note place="margin">2 Cor. 2, 15.</note> the ſweet ſauour of Chriſt) there is no neede to ſeeke for any other knowledge, or to make any farther Inquiry; for this is ſufficient of it ſelfe to make choyſe of him, and to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre vpon him the greateſt Offices of truſt; It being ſafer to put them into his hands, then into many of thoſe men, that are more in his Maieſties eye, and by ſight better knowen vnto him. For the beſt knowledge of man is by the eare. And he that will not beleeue me, let him reade Saint <hi>Auſtin,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Auguſt:</note> who in a Letter which he wrote to Saint <hi>Ierome,</hi> hauing expreſſed the great deſire and content that hee ſhould take in the knowledge and ſight of him, corrects that ſpeech of his, ſaying; That he had not ſpoken well, in ſaying; That he did not know him, becauſe he had ſeene his moſt learned bookes wherein were repreſented vnto him his very heart and ſoule. In like manner, he that ſhall be knowen by the like fame, or by the learned bookes, that hee hath written; Or if he be a ſouldier, by the great and noble Acts that hee hath done, or by his good gouernment, in thoſe places of Commaund which hee hath held; Such a one I ſay, is ſufficiently well knowen, though he had neuer put his head within the Court gates, or ſeene the Pallaces of Kings. The ſecond kind of knowledge, is that which your ambitious and ſolicitous pretenders doe giue of themſelues, who are ordinary Attendants and Aſſiſtents in the Courts and palaces of Kings and Princes, and the houſes of their Miniſters, ſeeking to inſinuate themſelues into their grace and fauour, by flatteries, Compliments, and Lyes, and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentimes by giftes and ſubornations, againſt which the doore is neuer ſhut, becauſe they carry about them (if need be) the Maſter Key, not a gilded key, but a key of pure golde, whoſe bitts and wardes are of diamonds, by which they make their way, remoue all difficulties, open the cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ningſt locks, and enter the ſtrongeſt caſtles. This is not that
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:180809:122"/>
knowledge, which is here required for conferring Offices vpon them, but rather to ſhut them out of all: For it is to be preſuppoſed, that theſe who doe thus negociate, and pay ſoundly for their places, muſt make their beſt profit of them and ſell at deare rates, that they may the ſooner get out of debt, and haue wherewith all to maintaine themſelues, their wiues, their children, and their familie. But to theſe kinde of men, Kings may (and with a great deale of reaſon) vſe by way of anſwer, thoſe words of our Sauiour Chriſt: <hi>Amen,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Mat. 28.12.</note> 
                  <hi>Amen, dico vobis, neſcio vos:</hi> Verily, verily, I ſay vnto you, I know you not.</p>
               <p>I will here likewiſe lay open one notable Coſenage and deceit, which kings, vſually ſuffer by the cunning plots, and bolde impudencies of pretenders, and by the fauour of thoſe which put to their helping hand, and giue them their beſt furtherance; And this it is: That when any of theſe pretenders is priuie to himſelfe, that hee hath not the like parts of Learning and Vertue and other abilities, as others haue, to mount at the firſt flight to thoſe high places, whereunto their ambition aſpireth, they ſeeke to enter into the baſeſt and meaneſt Offices, and that by baſe and vile meanes, either by buying them with their money, as good cheape as they can; and when their purſe cannot ſtretch ſo farre, worke themſelues in by the Codpiſſe, by match<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with this or that other Courtiers Kinſewoman, and other the like humane reſpects, making theſe the ſtepps for their preferrment. God deliuer all good Kings from ſuch kinde of Prouiſions; eſpecially if they be preferred by them to places of Audience, and of Iuſtice; for therein ſhall they ſinne grieuouſly, becauſe they put men into them, that are ignorant, and neceſſitated, who, for to relieue their wants, and to maintaine their Vanities, they, and their wiues take bribes, and ſet Iuſtice out to ſale. And ſo, not by degrees, and by little and little, but in all poſt haſte, (to the great preiudice of the Common-wealth) they goe ſtill aſcending
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:180809:122"/>
to greater places, and higher Dignities, wherein they goe on in doing greater hurt and more miſchiefe. And theſe kinde of men, are like vnto your <hi>Martinets,</hi> which if they be not raiſed from the earth, are not able to flye, but being raiſed neuer ſo little, they make a very high flight. So is it with theſe men, who not hauing ſufficiencie for the meaneſt places, are no ſooner raiſed a little by fauour, and by ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orning, from that firſt Office which they no way deſerued, but they afterwards make a higher pitch, and goe away with the beſt Offices in the Kingdome. And the errour in this, is, for that Kings doe thinke, that they are put in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to thoſe places for their merit, and good partes, when as indeed it is farre otherwiſe. Though ſometimes alſo it cometh ſo to paſſe, that Kings knowing how that ſuch a one is not fit for ſuch a place, or ſuch an Office, that they may put him out of that, clap him into another better and greater then the former, and which requireth greater parts, and more ſufficiencie; croſſing that ſentence of our Sauiour Chriſt (who is the eternall wiſdome of his father, and cannot lye:) That hee, that is not truſty in a little, is not to be truſted with much. Neither can he be held fit for the greater places, that hath not ſufficiencie in him for the leſſer.</p>

Wherefore, to ſeeke to runne any other courſe, ſauours of I know not what ſingularitie, raſhnes and preſumption. Hereunto I anſwer, that there is a great deale of difference betwixt ſueing to God, and ſueing to Men, and in the crauing of ſpirituall goods, and the crauing of Temporall.

And therefore we are to conſider, that for one of theſe two ends men may aske temporall things; Either for to raiſe themſelues, or to reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die themſelues.

Kings are to beſtow their fauours, but others muſt not ſue for them. <hi>Hoc non peti, ſed praſtari ſolere,</hi> ſaith ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Law; it is fit, good turnes ſhould be done, but not ſued for to be done. And it was the ſame mans ſaying; <hi>Inuitum, non ambientem, eſſe ad rempublicam aſſumendum:</hi> That he, that was vnwilling to receiue honour, not he that did ambiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly ſeek after it was to be preferred in the Common-wealth. And truſt me, I cannot ſearch into the reaſon, why it ſhould become a Cuſtome, not to giue, but to thoſe that aske; For neither they, that giue, doe gaine thereby, nor they that aske, are bettred thereby. For to giue, is ſo much the more worthy prayſe, and thankes, by how much the more liberally and freely it is giuen. And the Prouerb faith: <hi>Bis dat, qui citò dat:</hi> He doubles his gift, that giues quickly. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as he, that ſtays looking and expecting to be ſued vnto, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth to giue with an ill will, and not ſo freely as he ſhould. For (as <hi>Seneca</hi> truly ſaith) there is not any thing that coſtes a man dearer, then that which is bought by intreaties, and petitionings. And therefore, as often as either offices, or Rents, are beſtow'd on thoſe, which deſerue them, without making ſuite for them, the whole body of the Common-wealth doth commend and indeare the rectitude, and iuſt dealing of the Doner. And all good and vertuous men take heart and incouragement thereby, and are fill'd with good hopes; and thoſe, which are otherwiſe, aſhamed and confounded; and becomes the meanes many times of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king them turne ouer a new leafe, and leaue their former lewd courſe of life. But when this rigour and ſtrictneſſe is obſerued, of not giuing to him that asketh not, though hee merit and deſerue the ſame, it ſeemeth to be made a merito<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:180809:125"/>
cauſe, to ſue, and to negociate; and occaſion giuen, that more care ſhould be placed in this, then in deſeruing well, whereby mens mindes and courages, haue their edge abated, and are diſhartened. For to aske, when it is nor for the end aforeſayd, it draweth on this inconuenience with it. Which is <hi>Ariſtotles</hi> opinion, and is made good in all true reaſon of Morall Philoſophy. The Apoſtle S. <hi>Paul,</hi> quoteth a ſentence, which our Sauiour Chriſt vſed often to repeate; <hi>Beatius eſt magis dare, quam accipere:</hi> Farre more excellent, and more prayſe-worthy is it, to giue, then to take. And if not to take, be ſo good a thing, much better ſhall it be, not to aske, for that this is, the ordinary meanes to the other. And herein did the Saints of God glorie much, and Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith of himſelfe; That he would rather liue by the labour of his hands, then be importunate in crauing. And that great Prophet <hi>Samuel,</hi> that which he did moſt prize and iuſtifie himſelfe of before the people, was, that hee had faithfully performed his function, without crauing or taking any thing. There was a time, wherein the Romane Senate did ordaine, that the Conſullſhip, and other the chiefe Magiſtracies, ſhould not be giuen to any, ſaue ſuch as ſued for them. This Law, at firſt was good; for then, none durſt preſume to ſue for them, but thoſe, who in the peoples opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion did well deſerue them, and tooke it for a great affront that they ſhould receiue a deniall. So that by this meanes euery one did labour by his noble Actions to deſerue that Dignitie, as alſo that all the people might thinke him worthy thereof. Afterwards, this proued to be a very pernicious Law; for, not thoſe, who by their vertues, and heroicall Acts, did deſerue this Honour; but thoſe, that were the moſt powerfull did ſue for it, whileſt others, for feare of theſe, durſt not ſhew themſelues in the buſines, and ſo were vtterly excluded from thoſe honourable Offices. This in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conuenience, was taken notice of, and <hi>Publicola</hi> the Conſull made a Law, vpon paine of death, wherewith he was to be

puniſhed, who without approbation from the people of Rome, ſhould ſue for any of the ſaid Offices. And likewiſe, for the curbing of this Vice, was the <hi>Calphurnian</hi> Law enacted.

Not the better perſon, but the better purſe ſhall carry it. The inconueniences, that follow the ſo much fauouring of ſuitors, and being vn-mindfull of thoſe, who tend nothing elſe but to ſerue, and deſerue well, are very great, and not vnknowen to all thoſe that are Statiſts, and good Common-wealths men. And if the ſhortneſſe, which I deſire to obſerue in this Diſcourſe, did not hinder mee, a large field would here diſcouer it ſelfe vnto me, wherein to enter and expatiate my ſelfe, and might take occaſion to treate of the falſe hoods, ſhiftes, deceits, and iniuſtices, which are dayly vſed in ſuch like pretenſions, and petitions, which haue beene the cauſe of the deſtruction and ruine not only of particular Common wealthes but of whole Kingdomes. And this which I ſpeake, is of ſo much truth, that ſome of the Hebrew Doctors hold for certaine, that the Monarchie of the Houſe royall of <hi>Dauid</hi> was ouerthrowne by giuing credit to the malice and deceit of a couetous pretender, and that of twelue Prouinces which his heyres poſſeſſed, of thoſe twelue Tribes, two onely remayned intire vnto him. The caſe was this; King <hi>Dauid,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">2 Sam. 9.6.</note> hauing (in performance of that oath and promiſe, which he had made vnto <hi>Ionathan</hi>) giuen vnto his ſonne <hi>Mephiboſheth,</hi> all thoſe heredements,
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:180809:126"/>
meſſuage, and goods, which were King <hi>Sauls;</hi> And com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding <hi>Ziba,</hi> that hee, and his ſonnes, and his ſeruants, ſhould ſerue him, and till his land for him, and bring him in foode to eate; there entred into <hi>Ziba's</hi> minde a diueliſh pretenſion,<note place="margin">2.

When King <hi>Dauid</hi> fled from his ſonne <hi>Abſalon</hi> to the mountaines, <hi>Ziba</hi> the ſeruant of <hi>Mephiboſheth</hi> met him with a couple of Aſſes ſadled, and vpon them two hundred cakes of bread, and an hundred bunches of Rayſons, and an hundred of dryed Figgs, and a bottle of Wine, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the like commodities for the refreſhing of <hi>Dauid</hi> and his followers. And hauing a Lye ready at hand, which he had thought on before, hee caſtes himſelfe downe at the Kings feete, and telling him a thouſand leaſings, raiſed falſe witneſſe againſt <hi>Mephiboſheth,</hi> informing his Maieſtie, that <hi>Mephiboſheth</hi> was in <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> and tolde him; This day ſhall the houſe of <hi>Iſrael</hi> reſtore mee the Kingdome of my father. Is it euen ſo, ſayd the King? Behold, Thine are all, that pertained vnto <hi>Mephiboſheth.</hi> And truly, this buſineſſe was ſtrangely carryed. For notable was the faci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie, where-with the King gaue credit to the calumniation of this pretender, and the remiſſeneſſe which he ſhew'd in puniſhing ſo loud a lye, and ſo great a treaſon, when the truth of the matter, and the innocencie of <hi>Mephiboſheth,</hi> was af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards made knowne vnto him. And that, which I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue concerning this point, is; That the cauſe why hee did not puniſh this ſo fowle a treacherie, was; Either for that he was conſcious to himſelfe of the fault, which he had committed in hauing giuen ſuch eaſie beliefe there vnto: or, for that the rootes of this ſuſpicion, and iealouſie, did re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine ſtill deepely grounded in his heart.

In a word, mens hearts, and their tongues, doe not alwayes go together. Nor is the ſpeech, and the thought all one. <hi>Quia labia doloſo in corde, &amp; corde locuti ſunt.</hi>

O, how many inconueniences would be excuſed, if thoſe perſons, to whom the charge is committed of diſtributing Offices, and rewarding of ſeruices, would take the care, to conferre them on thoſe that deſerue them, and not on thoſe that negociate and ſue for them; then would there not be ſo much libertie, nor ſo many tricks vſed in petitioning, nor ſo many Orators in the Courte, in whom, by this ſuing vnto them, couetouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe

increaſeth, and the hungry appetite of taking; whileſt in the meane while all modeſtie and ſhame is vtterly loſt. And I am verily perſwaded, that kings many times, ſtreight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by earneſt intreaties, and the importunate prayers of ſuch as are in neere places about them, doe vndeſerued fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uours, rewarding vnworthy ſuitors, and leauing out thoſe that are worthy, becauſe they doe not offer to ſpeake and ſue vnto them. And that you may perceiue that I doe not ſpeake this of mine owne head, or that it is a birde of mine owne hatching, I will relate that here vnto you, which Saint <hi>Luke</hi> reporteth of an importunate woman,<note place="margin">Luk. 18.3.</note> who finding her ſelfe wronged, came to a ſecular Iudge, that was an ill minded man, and vniuſt, and was very earneſt with him, crying ſtill vnto him; doe me Iuſtice againſt mine Aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary: Which he would not of long time, but afterwards he ſayd with himſelfe; Though I feare not God, nor re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerence man, yet becauſe this woman troubleth me, I will doe her right, leſt at the laſt ſhee come, and make mee weary. To begge, and ſue, is an eaſiy office, eſpecially, when pretenders know, that hearing breedes weariſomneſſe, and that by this meanes they obtaine that which they ſue for, it being the nature of many men, and more particularly of Kings that loue their eaſe, to be quicke in their grants, for the avoyding of further trouble. Our Sauiours Diſciples, were much troubled, &amp; their eares were euen tyred out, with hearing the clamourous voyce of the <hi>Cana<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And we vſually ſee, that your importunate ſuitors, be it iuſt, or vniuſt, obtaine their purpoſe. And I know not, whether I may blame them moſt, or thoſe that put them to it, to be importunate in this, or that, be it right, or be it wrong.

                  <hi>Naſus tuus</hi> (ſaith her beloued) <hi>Sicut Turris Libani, quae reſpicit contra Damaſcum:</hi> Thy noſe, is as the Tower of <hi>Lebanon,</hi> which looketh toward <hi>Damaſcus.</hi> And the Expoſitors vpon this booke of the <hi>Canticles,</hi> doe ſtand much vpon theſe words, for that they ſeeme to be much contrarie vnto that, which ſhould extoll and ſet forth a beauty to it's full perfection For in very deede, a huge and diſproportionable noſe, both ſeemes, and is, a fowle and ougly thing. And therefore thoſe interpreters ſay, that it is not to be vnderſtood in that firſt ſence which offers it ſelfe vnto vs, which is grammaticall; but in it's myſticall and ſpirituall ſignification, which by a generall conſent re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſenteth vnto vs, the admirable prudence of the Church in the gouernment of Soules, a thing of greateſt importance, and the moſt neceſſary, in Prelates and Gouernours, and more particularly, in Kings, and Princes. <hi>Naſus tuus; ſicut Turris Libani:</hi> Thy noſe is as the Tower of <hi>Lebanon;</hi> Which King <hi>Salomon</hi> built, that from thence he might be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold, and ſee, all whatſoeuer paſſed in <hi>Damaſcus.</hi> From thence, might he diſcouer his enemies, and their ambuſhes, and the theeues lying in waite to rob <hi>Ieruſalem.</hi> Of this
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:180809:128"/>
Tower, they ſay, that it was very high, euen, and ſtreight, and for to repreſent the beautie of the face of the Spouſe, it is (and with a great deale of proprietie) ſayd; That her noſe is like a Tower; for that, which doth moſt beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie a Citie, or any other place whatſoeuer, is a fayre high Tower. In like manner in the face of any perſon, the noſe, which is that, which is eleuated and lifted vp aboue all the other parts of the face, expreſſeth great beautie, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as, to be without a noſe, or to haue it too hooked, or too flat, extraordinarily crooked, or extraordinarily little, is a foule deformitie. And therefore, the ſumme of all, that hitherto hath beene ſayd, is; That, what a goodly fayre Tower doth, in the adoring and ſetting forth of a Citie, which doth exceedingly grace and beautify the ſame; The ſame doth the noſe in the face of the Spouſe, which is ſo well proportioned, that it much commendeth all the whole feature. And vpon this<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Litterall, leaneth the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall ſence of this place; which is: That this Tower doth denotate diſcretion, and prudence, which exalts it ſelfe aboue all other the workes of Vertue, and doth grace and beautifie them all. Many of the Gentiles erected Fortune for their Goddeſſe; It ſeeming vnto them, that ſhee was the onely Lady, and Miſtris of all good, and bad ſucceſſe; But others, which drew neerer vnto Truth, and Reaſon, made a ieſt thereof, and ſayd; That it was not Fortune, that afforded happineſſe, and proſperitie, but prudence; and that ſhee was rather Fortunes Miſtris, and that her power did predominate ouer the Starres. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſayd another.</p>

               <p>No Deitie, no power, is wanting to him, that is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dewed with wiſedome. Men of ſmall vnderſtanding, and ſuch as are careleſſe in their buſineſſes, attribute Diuini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie to Fortune, that they may free them ſelues from the note and imputation of careleſneſſe, and imprudencie. But the
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:180809:128"/>
truth is, that fortune ſtays not behinde, when prudence ſetts forward. And therefore it was well ſayd of <hi>Saluſt;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Saluſt.</note> 
                  <hi>Vnus quiſque eſt artifex fortunae ſua;</hi> Euery man is the worker out of his own fortune. And the Spaniſh Prouerb tells vs, <hi>Que la buena diligencia, es la madre de la bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enauentura:</hi> That good diligence, is the mother of good ſucceſſe. So that in very deede, there is neither good, nor bad Fortune, but it is the will of God, that rules and gouerns all; and the care, and prudence, wherewith men haue recourſe vnto that, which is fit and conuenient for them. And therefore is prudence in Kings, of that great importance, and ought to be, (as we ſayd of the Spouſes noſe) like a high tower; and not according to that modell as they would haue it, but it muſt be placed vpon Mount <hi>Lebanon;</hi> to the end, that being in ſo high and eminent a place, it may make the better diſcouery. Kings muſt haue an eye as well to that which is a far off, as that which is neere at hand; on this ſide, and on that; heere, there, and euery where. They muſt bee ready to ſupply vpon this, or that other occaſion; They muſt ſee, and foreſee all.<note place="margin">Terentius.</note> 
                  <hi>Iſtud eſt ſapere, non quod ante pedes modò eſt videre, ſed etiam illa, quae futura ſunt, proſpicere,</hi> ſayd the Comicke: This, in realtie, is true wiſedome, not to ſee that onely which is before his feete, but to foreſee that alſo which is to come. And this prouidence, circumſpection, or prudencie, ſound alike, and are in a manner one, and the ſame thing. The Ancient did ſo artificially paint prudencie, that ſhee ſeemed to looke euery way, and to haue her eyes fixed on whatſoeuer did behold her. For prudence, as it is ſilent, ſo it is ſearching; nothing eſcapes her knowledge. And it is a vertue that maketh Kings like vnto God. For, as hee, by his diuine prouidence, doth foreſee all, and gouerne all and hath all things preſent before him, ſo they by their humane pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, which participateth of the diuine, behold things
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:180809:129"/>
paſt, diſpoſe of things preſent, and prouide for things to come. Some call her <hi>Filiam Dei,</hi> Gods daughter, becauſe it ſeemed vnto them, that ſhee had ſomething of the Deitie in her, that ſhee was his Miniſter in the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the world, and diſpoſition of all things, and ought likewiſe to be the Miſtris of Kings vpon all their occaſions. For (as <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> and <hi>Plato</hi> avouch) no man can gouerne well, that is not prudent. In an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient times, the Common people were of opinion, that Prudence was annexed vnto Kings, and that they had a particular gift to fore-ſee that, which was to come. And ſuch, as were prouident, and prudent, they held to bee Diuine. True it is, that wiſedome is the gift of God, and wee muſt craue it of him, as did <hi>Moſes, Ioſhua, Dauid, Salomon,</hi> and other wiſe Kings. Which to obtaine, wee muſt ſhunne and flye from ſinne; for, it is impoſſible that hee ſhould bee prudent, that is not vertuous. And ſo much hath a man of prudence, as hee hath of vertue. And according to this meaſure, ſhall the authoritie, credite, and opinion bee which hee ſhall hold with the people. The Offices and effects, which Prudence doth, and cauſeth, are many; And ſome of them are collected, out of the many and various expoſitions which the Doctors attribute to this Tower, and noſe of the Spouſe, which we will goe diſpoſing, by it's Paragraphes, in this chapter.</p>

and theſe are miſlik't of all; but that, as much commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, which ſignifies magnanimitie, bountifullneſſe, and ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerouſnes, and is of ſufficient largeneſſe to ſuffer and diſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble anger, and not to haue the chimney choaked with a little ſmoake. A qualitie, ſo much importing Kings, that from thence did ariſe that Prouerb; <hi>Qui neſcit diſsimulare neſcit regnare:</hi> Hee that knowes not how to diſſemble, knowes not how to rule. And there was a King of late times, which ſtickt not to ſay; that hee would not haue his ſonne know any more Learning, then that which this ſentence doth containe; for that it was ſo good and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable a Leſſon for Princes. <hi>Tiberius Caeſar,</hi> did glorie in no one thing more, then in the Arte of Diſſimulation, wherein he was ſo excellent, that neuer any, vpon any, though neuer ſo great occaſions giuen by him, could ſearch into his intents, or diue into his thoughts. In the ſtory of the Kings, it is written; That at the very ſame time, that God commaunded the poſſeſſion of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, to be giuen vnto <hi>Saul,</hi> which was the firſt King he had nominated, ſome ill diſpoſed perſons, that were malitiouſly bent againſt him, did murmure at him, and ſpeake ill of him, ſeeming to ſcorne, and ſet light by him. But God had giuen him ſuch a meaſure of wiſedome, and diſcretion, that although all that they had ſayd, came to his eare, <hi>Ipſe verò diſsimulabat ſe audire:</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1 King. 10.27.</note> Yet hee held his peace, and would not ſeeme to take notice of it. For, when Kings come newly to their Crownes, and that the things of the Kingdome are not yet throughly ſettled, it is great pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence to reſerue with diſſimulation the puniſhment of great perſons, that with better occaſion, and in a better coniuncture, he may proceed againſt them, as reaſon and Iuſtice ſhall require. That King ſhall not be accounted wiſe, that ſhall pretend execution of Iuſtice with the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of Inſurrections, and ſeditions; nor ſhall the iuſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his intent, ſuffice to execute his raſhneſſe in the

For in ſuch caſes, it is great wiſedome in a King<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to conforme himſelfe according to the times; And that that which at one time is worthy of puniſhment, ſhould be diſſembled, and reſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued to be puniſhed at another time.

This perill, he ouerpaſt by his great prudence, diſſembling the
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:180809:131"/>
matter for that time, and deferring it till the laſt vp-ſhut, when now the buſineſſes of the Kingdome were better ſettled; For, the moſt important point in gouernment, is, to make vſe of Time, and occaſion: facilitating with ſilence and diſſimulation, thoſe orders and decrees, which doe croſſe the peoples humour, or that ſtand not with his liking that is powerfull with them; For if they ſhould be divul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged before their due time and ſeaſon, they would ſerue for nothing elſe, but to incenſe mens mindes, and perad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenture to turne them againſt himſelfe. Which certainly might well haue beene <hi>Dauids</hi> caſe with <hi>Ioab,</hi> if hee had ſhewed himſelfe offended, and openly vented his ſpleene againſt him, whileſt he had his ſword in his hand, and ſtood ſo fayre in the peoples affection; who in that hurre might haue done (God he knowes what) for the aduan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing of his ambitious ends. In ſuch caſes, it is great pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in a Prince, (contineuing ſtill firme and conſtant in his purpoſe) to benefit himſelfe by diſſimulation, wai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting for a fit time and ſeaſon, when without danger hee may vnmaske himſelfe, and with the ſafety of his realme and perſon, put his reſolution in execution. A word well kept, and fittly ſpoken, is (ſaith <hi>Salomon</hi>) like apples of gold,<note place="margin">Prou. 25.11.</note> in pictures of ſiluer; which doth not onely ſhine and giue a glorious luſter, but worketh it's effect, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couereth the art and cunning of it's Maſter. And King <hi>Dauid</hi> hauing heard the reproachfull words, and reuiling tearmes which <hi>Shimei</hi> to the very face of him, and in a loud voyce, vttred in the preſence of thoſe that were with him, wiſely diſſembled his rayling, and was angry with <hi>Abiſhai,</hi> becauſe he was earneſt with him, that hee might preſently take due chaſticement of him, and reuenge the great affront hee had done him, and would by no meanes giue conſent, that any one of all his Army ſhould once moue or ſtirre againſt him. For, that holy King thought it fit in his wiſedome, to leaue him to that occaſion,
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:180809:131"/>
which hee afterwards ſpecified to his ſonne <hi>Salomon;</hi> that he might teach Kings theſe two things. Firſt to relye on God, and to attend his leaſure, who will doe that for them, which they cannot doe for themſelues; As he did in that known caſe of <hi>Moſes</hi> brothers murmuring againſt him, which hee himſelfe ſo mildely and fayrely diſſembled. But God, to whoſe account runn's the honour of his Miniſters, tooke the cauſe into his owne hands. Secondly; That it is not fit to be ſolicitous in appointing Iudges, and Informers, at all howers, and in all places, againſt ſuch, as in ſome occaſions, aſſume libertie of ſpeech, and freely vtter their mindes. For, as another ſayd; In free places, and perſons that are likewiſe free-borne, wee cannot at all times exerciſe that ſlauery vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them, as to clap a Locke and chaine vpon their tongues. Who could haue done this better, then that omnipotent King <hi>Chriſt Ieſus,</hi> when thoſe licentious and looſe-tongued <hi>Libertines,</hi> reproached him with ſuch ſharpe &amp; bitter Tau<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Kings ought not to expreſſe any alteration, turbation, or diſcompoſure, for thoſe things which they ſee, nor to be ſtartled euery foote with that, which they heare, nor to ſhew themſelues offended at that, which is muttred and murmured of them. But let them (a god's name) mend that, which is amiſſe, and then their mutte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring and murmuring will ceaſe of it ſelfe. Heere likewiſe Kings are taught, not to be curious inquirers after thoſe, that ſpeake ill of them, nor to giue eare to euery idle com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint; For if it be once perceiued, that their eares irche af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter this, infinite will the number of Delators, and Informers be. In the raigne of <hi>Tiberius,</hi> and of <hi>Nero,</hi> more then in any other were theſe <hi>Sycophants</hi> and priuie Accuſers fauou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red; and things were then ſo glazed ouer, that they had ſet ſpies, that ſhould curiouſly obſerue the ſemblance, which e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery

But it is fitter for Tyrants then Chriſtian Kings, to ſtand thus in feare of the tongues of the vulgar, it being the part of a magnanimous minde, to know how to forget, and forgiue in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iuries, eſpecially thoſe of the tongue, to whoſe iuriſdiction, the moſt powerfull, are moſt ſubiect. And if they ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenge this wrong vpon account, the number would be ſo great, and riſe to ſuch an infinite ſum, that they may quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly being their Monarchie to an end.

Such effects doth the ſmooth breaſt, and ſoft heart of a King worke; And this is ſo ſure a Tenet, that for to keepe a Kingdome ſecure, and to be Lord of many moe, there needeth no other claime, then that which Loue and Gentleneſſe maketh. For, in regard that the heart of man is generous, it will not be led by the necke with a halter, nor will ſubiects long indure the yoake of a Tyrannizing and proud Lord: whereas on the contrary, they are eaſily led a long, by a ſmooth and gentle hand. And reaſon teacheth vs as much; for by how much the more eaſily is the heart of man moued by conueniences, then by menaces, by faire meanes then by foule, by ſo much the better is it to gouerne by meekeneſſe and gentleneſſe, then by force and rigour. Whence we draw this Concluſion, That too much ſharpneſſe, and exceſſe of rigour in a Prince, procureth hatred; and affabilitie and clemencie, Loue. Which is that, which Kings ought moſt to ſeeke after, as by and by we ſhall ſhew vnto you, when wee come to tell you, that theſe two qualities of blandure, and clemencie, ſo befitting a ſupreme Lord, are quite contrarie to that good expedition of Iuſtice, and that integritie, which God doth require in a Iudge; whom hee willeth and commaundeth. That in matter of iudgement, hee ſhall not pittie the caſe of the poore: According to which Inſtruction, it of force followeth, that a King muſt repreſent two contrary perſons; that of a kinde and pittifull Father; and that of a iuſt, and angry Iudge. For, if in his owne nature, hee be kinde, and tender hearted, there is not that offender, which will not be ſet free by the power of Intreaties, and Teares, weapons;
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:180809:135"/>
wherewith the hardeſt and cruelleſt hearts ſuffer them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues to be ouercome. And if he be otherwiſe, what can the delinquents hopes end in, but death and deſpaire? Againe, if he be vertuous, and ſeuere, it is impoſſible that he ſhould not hate the vicious, and grow into choller, when hee ſhall heare of their cruell outrages and inſolencies. Now,<note place="margin">Hier. Sup. Ierom. <hi>22.</hi> Aug. lib. <hi>5.</hi> de Ciuit. cap. <hi>24.</hi> Iſid. lib. <hi>3.</hi> Sent. cap. <hi>52.</hi> S.

                     </note> what remedy in this caſe is to be vſed? Saint <hi>Ierom,</hi> and Saint <hi>Auſten,</hi> are of opinion, that a King, by his owne perſon, is to puniſh, and premiate, to execute chaſticement with iuſtice, and to mitigate it with mercy. Nor is it vnwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy our conſideration, nor lyable to inconueniencie, that a King ſhould repreſent two perſons, ſo contrary in ſhew, as iudging with Iuſtice, and Mercie. For two vertues cannot bee contrary. And as the Saints and holy Doctors ſay, (and they are in the right) Mercie doth not hinder the execution of Iuſtice, but it moderateth the crueltie of the puniſhment. And it is very neceſſary in a good Iudge, that hee ſhould haue a true and faithfull paire of balance in his hands, and in either ſcale to put rigor, and equitie, that hee may know how to correct the one by the other. The Kings of <hi>Portugall,</hi> (eſpecially <hi>Don Iuan</hi> the third) did vſe to iudge Capitall crimes, accompanied with his Councell, and were alway accounted fathers of the people, becauſe with them, Iuſtice, and Mercie, walked hand in hand; ſhewing them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues iuſt in puniſhing the fault, and mercifull in mitiga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the puniſhment. By which meanes, they were of all, both feared and beloued. And let not Kings perſwade themſelues, that this doth leſſen their authoritie, and take of from their greatneſſe, but giues an addition; and the oftner they ſit in iudgement, they ſhall doe God the more ſeruice, and the Kingdome more good: And in conſcience, the ſureſt and ſafeſt courſe, for that recipro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call obligation, which is between the King and his ſubiects. For they owe obedience, ſeruice, and acknowledgement to him, as their Lord and Maſter. And he vnto them, Iuſtice,
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:180809:136"/>
Defence and Protection. For to this end and purpoſe, doe they pay him ſo many great Tributes, and Taxes. Nor is it enough for him to doe it by others, but he muſt alſo doe it by himſelfe. For, neither that great Gouernor of Gods people, <hi>Moſes,</hi> nor any other after him, is, in all the whole body of the Bible to be found, that euer yet condemned the occupation of iudging the people, to bee vnworthy royall Maieſtie nor contrarie to the reputation of a King. I know no other preiudice in it, ſaue that it is impoſſible for one ſole man, to vndergoe ſo great a taske. And this impoſſibilitie ariſeth from the multitude of ſubiects; and in that caſe, they aduiſe, That a King ſhould not wholly take away his hand from the doing of Iuſtice, but that the leſſer and more ordinary buſineſſes, hee ſhould remit and referr them to different Miniſters, and the weightier cauſes, take to his owne charge, and be preſent in perſon, when they come to be ſit vpon, and determined; as formerly haue done the wiſeſt and greateſt Monarkes, that euer were in the world. Who did euer equall King <hi>Salomon,</hi> in wiſedome, greatneſſe, and Maieſtie? yet did hee hold it no diſgrace vnto him, to humble himſelfe to heare ſuitors, iudge their cauſes and to doe them Iuſtice. The Kings of the Hebrew people, were called Iudges, becauſe they did glorie in nothing ſo much, as to heare, and iudge the people. And in all Nations, this hath alwayes beene the principall Office appertaining vnto Kings. And the Holy Ghoſt ſaith; That the King,<note place="margin">Prou. 29.14.</note> that faithfully iudgeth the poore, his throne ſhall be eſtabliſhed for euer.</p>

And therefore, it is not onely conueni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, but neceſſarie, that they ſhould ſeeke to gaine the good wills of all, ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting themſelues, (though they force their owne) to the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of their ſubiects, and beholding them, as if they were his children. Which is the beſt courſe to keepe them well affected, and contented, and to be beloued, and obayed by them. Which they may eaſily doe, if they will but thinke themſelues, that they are ſheepheards, and fathers of thoſe people, which God hath recommended vnto them, eaſing them of thoſe wrongs and grieuances, which they vniuſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſuffer; laying no more vpon them, then they are able to beare; ſuffring them, when reaſon ſhall require, to take their eaſe and their quiet; and helping to ſuſtaine them, when they grow poore, and are decayd. <hi>Plato</hi> tells vs, That for a Prince to be good, and to be beloued of all, hee muſt beſtow all his loue, and his whole heart, vpon the Common-wealth; his will, on the Gods; his ſecret, on his friends; and his Time, on buſineſſes. For, by thus reparting himſelfe with all, he ſhall haue a part in all, by all of them comming to vnite themſelues with him. Onely in this good Correſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pondency of Loue betweene Kings, and their ſubiects, wiſe <hi>Periander</hi> placeth all the ſafetie, and good fortune of
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:180809:137"/>
Kings and Kingdomes. <hi>Ageſilaus,</hi> King of <hi>Lacedaemon,</hi> was once askt the queſtion, How a King might liue ſecure; For that it is oftentimes ſeene, that neither multitude of ſeruants, nor a guard of Halbardiers can defend them from violence? To which demand, hee returned this anſwer: <hi>Si ſuis populis ita imperet, vt parentes filijs;</hi> If he ſo rule ouer his people, as a father doth ouer his children. The King that loueth his ſubiects, and is againe beloued by them, neede no guarde, they are his guard. For Loue, where it is true and faithfull, plaineſheth the knottieſt peece of timber, ſmootheth the rougheſt and moſt vnhewen diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, and makes all faire, ſafe, and peaceable. It is a moſt ſtrong wall, and more durable, yea then Kings them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues. With this, no difficulty can offer it ſelfe vnto them, which they may not ouercome; no danger, whoſe impetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe they may not oppoſe; no command, which they will not obay. For as Kings deſire no more of their ſubiects, but to be well ſerued by them; ſo ſubiects, pretend nothing from their Kings, but to be beloued by them. And indeede, the one dependeth on the other. For, if a King loue not his ſubiects, he ſhall neither be well ſerued, beloued, nor obayed by them. And as little, if he loue him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe too much. For the more care he takes of himſelfe and at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends his owne particular, ſo much the more his ſubiects loue departs from him. For the harmonie of a Common-wealth conſiſteth, in that all ſhould liue by the Kings fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour, and they by their ſubiects loue. For they ought to be vigilant in all that belongs to their ſeruice: and Kings moſt watchfull in that, which concernes their generall good: So that none is to haue leſſe part in the King, then the King himſelfe. And becauſe it is impoſſible to content all, by reaſon not onely of their different, but contrary natures, it is neceſſary at leaſt to content the moſt. There are two dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences of States, or two ſorts of people, to be conſidered in a Kingdome; The Citizens, (or which comprehendeth all) the common people: Or your Peeres, and ſuch as either
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:180809:137"/>
are perſons of Title, or aſpire to be. It ſhall be good diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion &amp; prudence, to procure to content the people, (eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially in a Kings firſt entrance into his raigne) in that which is reaſonable and honeſt. And if their demaunds ſhall be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe, to diſſemble with them, and to take time to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider of it, and ſo by little and litle, let their blood goe coo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling. This was the Counſayle of your olde Counſailours. Which had it beene followed by that young King <hi>Reho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boam,</hi> his people had not rebelled againſt him,<note place="margin">3 King. 11.</note> nor hee in the beginning of his Empire, (before he was ſcarce warme in his throne) haue loſt ten Tribes of the Twelue. The Common people, are alwayes grumbling, and complayning, and ready to runne into rebellion, as being feareleſſe, in regard of their multitude, and careleſſe, for that they haue little or nothing to looſe. The <hi>Minor Plinie,</hi> after that hee had made a large Catalogue of the naturall vertues of the Emperour <hi>Traiane,</hi> after that he had ſhewen what great ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count he made of the Common people, he ſayth; Let not a Prince deceiue himſelfe, in thinking, that hee is not to make any reckoning of the common people; for without them he cannot ſuſtaine, nor defend his Empyre. And in vaine ſhall hee procure other helpe, for that were to ſeeke to liue with a head, without a body; which beſides that it were mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrous, it muſt needes toter and tumble downe with it's owne weight, becauſe it hath nothing to beare it vp. And if Kings will needes know what kinde of thing the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon people is, and what able to doe vpon all changes and alterations, let them take into their conſideration, that which paſſed at the arraignment and death of our Sauiour Chriſt, where there was not that Rule of reaſon of State in the vileſt manner, which was not then practized. And the firſt ſtone that the Princes of the Scribes and Phariſees moued againſt him, was the people; for they knew well enough, that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out them they could not awe, and feare <hi>Pilate,</hi> nor moue him by their accuſations, and falſe witneſſes to condemne him.
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:180809:138"/>
In the next place, they had recourſe to the particular con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueniency of the Iudge, that he ſhould not be a friend vnto <hi>Caeſar,</hi> but ſhould looſe his loue, if vpon this occaſion the people ſhould riſe and rebell; by which tricke they inclined him to their partie, and wrought him to preferre his priuate Intereſt, before publicke Iuſtice, and his owne preſeruation, before that which was both honeſt and reaſonable. Againe, it is more ſecure, to procure the fauour and loue of the people, and more eaſie to effect his purpoſe by them. More ſecure, becauſe without their loue and aſſiſtance, no alteration in the ſtate can take effect. This their loue doth vphold Kings, and gets them the opinion of good and vertuous Princes. This qualifieth all wrongs, or makes the offenders pay ſoundly for them, againſt whom none dare ſeeme to be ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular. Laſtly, for that the common people; hauing onely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to their particular profit &amp; their own priuate Intereſt, cannot deſire nor pretend that, which your greater Peeres, and principall men of the State do, who alwayes (out of their ambition) aſpire to more, and ſtand beating their braines, how they may compaſſe that, which their imagination tells them they want; And by ſo much the more doth this their Ambition increaſe, in how much the greater place they are, and in a neere poſſibilitie of that which they deſire. I ſayd (before) more eaſie; becauſe the people content themſelues with aequalitie (and this likewiſe makes well for Kings) with the adminiſtration of Iuſtice with common eaſe and reſt, with plenty, and with the mildeneſſe, gentleneſſe, and peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ableneſſe of him that ruleth ouer them. Now, that Kings may procure this popular loue, it is fit they ſhould make choyſe of ſuch Miniſters, as are well beloued of the people, that will heare them with patience; comfort, and hearten them vp, that they may the more willingly beare the bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens that are laid vpon them, the Tributes, Taxes, and trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles of the Kingdome, which in the end muſt light all vpon them. For it is not to be doubted, and experience teacheth the
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:180809:138"/>
truth of it, That the Miniſters and ſeruants of a Prince, make him either beloued, or hated; And all their defects or Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues turne to his hurt, or profit. And let not Kings make ſlight reckoning thereof, nor let them colour it ouer with Reaſons of State; For he, that once begins to be ha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ed out of an ill conceiued opinion, they charge him withall that is either well, or ill done. For, there is nothing, be it neuer ſo good, which being ill interpreted, may not change it's firſt qualitie in the eyes of men, who iudge things by apparences: Which is another principall cauſe, why Princes ought to procure the loue of the people. For, in concluſion, moſt cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine it is, that the Common people, is not onely the Iudge of Kings, but is their Attourny, alſo whoſe cenſure none of them can eſcape; And is that Miniſter, which God makes choyſe of for to puniſh them in their name and fame, which is the greateſt of all Temporall puniſhments. Suting with that which we ſayd heeretofore of the voyce of the people, that it is the voyce of God. For his diuine Maieſtie vſeth this as a meanes to torment thoſe, who haue no other ſuperiour vpon earth. And therefore it behoueth them to preuent this miſchiefe, and to winne vnto them the peoples affection by as many wayes as poſſibly they can deuiſe, as by their owne proper perſon with ſome; with other ſome, by their fauou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rites and familiar friends; and with all by their Miniſters. For, there is not ſuch a <hi>Tully,</hi> nor <hi>Demoſthenes,</hi> withall their eloquence, for to prayſe, or diſprayſe the Actions of a King, either to ſalue, or condemne them, as is the peoples loue, or hatred. A great cauſe likewiſe of procuring this loue, and to winne the hearts of the people, &amp; to giue them all good con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, will be, if Kings would be but pleaſed, who are Lords of many Kingdomes, and Prouinces, to haue neere about them naturall Miniſters and Counſaylours of all the ſayd ſeuerall Kingdomes, and Prouinces; For Common-wealths, &amp; king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes, riſent it exceedingly, to ſee themſelues caſt out of ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and gouernment, when they doe not ſee at the
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:180809:139"/>
Kings elbow, or in his Counſell any one of their own nation, and countrie, conceiuing, that they doe either baſely eſteeme of them, or that they dare not truſt them; Whence, the one ingendreth hatred, and the other, deſireth libertie. Let a King therefore conſider with himſelfe, that hee is a publicke perſon, and that he ought not to make himſelfe particular; that he is a naturall Citizen of all his Kingdomes and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uinces; and therefore ought not willingly to make himſelfe a ſtranger to any one of them. That he is a father to them all, &amp; therfore muſt not ſhew himſelf a Step-father to any. And therefore let him ſtill haue ſome one naturall childe of euery Prouince in his Councel. For, it is a great vnhapines to a king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, not to haue any one childe of theirs (amongſt ſo many) by the Kings ſide, with whom the Naturalls thereof may holde the better correſpondencie. For theſe more ſpeedily, &amp; with more diligence and loue, treate and diſpatch their buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes, then ſtrangers either can or will, who muſt be ſued vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, and will do nothing but vpon earneſt intreaty, or by force and compulſion, or like good wary Merchants, by trading for ready mony. Let Kings weigh with themſelues, that it is as naturall a worke in them to afforde fauour vnto all, as in a tree to afford fruit<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And it is a great glorie to a king, to oblige all nations to loue him. For that King much deceiueth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, who will make himſelfe King of this, or that Prouince, and no more; Sithence, that God himſelfe, whom he repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenteth on earth, profeſſes himſelfe, to be Lord of t'one, and t'other, and of all. And therefore, hee that is Lord of many, ſhould not throw all his loue and affection on a few. Let him in ſuch ſort conferre his fauours on the one, that he may not giue occaſion of affront and diſgrace to the other. For, theſe generall fauours, make much for the honor and eſtimation of Kings. It faring with them, as it doth with thoſe trees, when all ſorts of paſſengers, goe gathering, &amp; inioying their fruits.</p>
                  <p>I ſay farther that for the augmentation and conſeruation of the loue of Common-wealths, and Kingdomes, towards

their Kings, (a maine and principall point, which ought to be eſteemed in more, then other great treaſures) it will be very conuenient (and is the Counſayle of perſons of great pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dencie, throughly acquainted with Kings, and Kingdomes) that they ſhould haue ſome perſon, or perſons of theſe good parts and qualities; To wit: Men of good naturall abilities, &amp; of great wiſedom, to whom in particular, they ſhould ommit the care to heare thoſe that are wronged, and male-content. For the graces and fauours of Kings, as proceeding from humane power, which cannot doe all it would, haue euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more beene leſſe in number then the pretenders. And therefore muſt of force follow, that there muſt needs bee a great number of diſcontented perſons in all Kingdomes, euen in the beſt, and moſt ſweetely gouerned. Some hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding themſelues wronged, induced thereunto by their own opinion; others, by disfauours; Some, by bad diſpatch; others, by delayes; And ſome, (and thoſe perhapps the moſt) by finding themſelues deceiued in their pretenſions; A thing that ought much to be thought on, though there be few, that take pleaſure to heare on that eare. Theſe men, I ſay, troubled with cares, and tranſported with paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, thruſt themſelues into all Companies, great, and ſmall, high, and low, entring into diſcourſe with Male-Contents, and laying open their wounds vnto them; which kinde of men, I would haue to be kindly dealt withall, that the Kings Miniſters, ſhould giue them the hearing, that they ſhould temper and allay this their paſſion, that they ſhould hearten and encourage them, and indeede make ſhew in ſome things to goe hand in hand with them, though it be in ſome ſort againſt their king and Maſter, ſeeking rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons to maintaine their part, and that hee cannot blame them if they complaine, hauing ſo much cauſe, laying the fault either on the iniquitie of the times, or the care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſeneſſe of thoſe, through whoſe fingers theſe things were to paſſe; and that, as it was no fault of the Kings, for not
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:180809:140"/>
hauing beene truly informed, ſo can hee not but reſt well aſſured of their good bowells, and ſound intention to his Maieſtie and the State. This is a cunning artifice, and admirable art, againſt that deadly poyſon, of thoſe mens hatred and diſcontent, which repute themſelues wronged and diſgraced. And the better will this take with them, if this care be committed to ſuch either perſon, or perſons, that are well liked and beloued of the people, and haue to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with their naturall grace, the grace of heauen, a gift which Kings can neither giue, nor take away; how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit, they giue that grace and fauour, whence reſulteth the peoples reſpect. For, it will not alwayes ſerue the turne, to bee beloued of all; nor will this generall loue ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times excuſe him from being hated of many. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in this the grace of heauen muſt bee ſought after, and ſuch a man made choyſe of, as hath this naturall gift; for by the helpe thereof, hee ſhall be the better be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loued, and ouer them all haue the more commaund. This Counſayle, was well eſteemed and approued by that wiſe and prudent King, <hi>Don Philip</hi> the ſecond, as a very neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary, &amp; conuenient meanes for to temper mens mindes, &amp; to get generall notice of all that paſſeth, either in word or deed, and thereupon be able to giue all poſſible remedie thereunto. And this aduice pleaſed him ſo well, that hee committed the execution thereof to him that gaue it him and purpoſely remitted ſome buſineſſes vnto him, that he might haue the better occaſion to ſound mens mindes, and to effect what he pretended by that kinde of courſe: And in ſhort time gaue good ſatisfaction by the proofe, and made knowen to his Maieſtie how much good was incloſed in this Artifice, for the conſeruation of Kings, and Kingdomes.</p>

And ſuch a one as this, a King ought to haue. And certaine it is, that if that olde Serpent had not had that hap in that firſt deceit, exerciſed on our firſt Mother <hi>Eue,</hi> it had beene needeleſſe for one man to watch another and to be ſo wary and circumſpect, as now they are. But becauſe he, with ſuch great craft, and ſubtle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, did powre forth this his poyſon into the originall foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine of our nature, it was neceſſary that againſt this his venome, we ſhould take this <hi>Antidote</hi> and <hi>Treacle,</hi> for a preſeruatiue, and preuent one poyſon, by another.

It is a great happineſſe for prudent Kings, and for thoſe Princes alſo, that haue not as yet gained with all men the opinion of wiſe, that ſome occaſions might be of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered vnto them, wherein they might catch theſe crafty &amp; ſubtill Foxes; And they ought purpoſely to hunt after them, &amp; to perfourme ſome exteriour, and publick actions in order to this end: And ſo to carry them, that all the people may take notice of them. For therby, they ſhall gaine a great deale of authoritie and reputation throughout the Kingdome.

Inſomuch that when they ſaw how wiſely, &amp; how iuſtly it was carryed by him, they ſhouted all for ioy, ſaying; ſurely, the wiſedom of God is in him; And from thence forth they began to reſpect, &amp; feare him. Yet miſtake me not, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeech yee; For, I do not ſay, that Kings ſhould deſire, that any ill ſhould betide any man; but that they ought, &amp; may deſire, that ſome ſuch occaſion might be offered vnto them, wherein they might ſhew their zeale and loue vnto Iuſtice, and mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt to the world, that they are wiſe enough of themſelues to execute the ſame. For there is nothing, that makes a King more worthy of his Monarchie, as to win, by meanes of his good Counſel and gouerment, greater credit and authoritie, then what he had, when he began firſt to gouern: For a king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome is only the gift of fortune; but this other, argues his owne wiſedome, and iudgement.</p>
                  <p>But that, which I ſhall conclude this point withall, is this;
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:180809:143"/>
That this prudence &amp; ſagacitie of the Serpent, ſo much com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended by <hi>Chriſt,</hi> ioyned with the Doues ſimplicitie, produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth two effects of much importance in kings, which are theſe Neither to deceiue, nor to be deceiued. Simplicitie, is without welt or garde, plaine &amp; true, and knowes not how to deceiue any man. Prudence, on the other ſide, is very wary &amp; circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect, and will not ſuffer her ſelfe to be deceiued by any man. Nay, it goes a little farther; for it perfecteth the whole eſſence and being of prudence, and cauſeth a certaine dexteritie in the diſpatch of buſineſſes, which is a great help vnto Princes, and is the only Miſtris to make them to vnderſtand &amp; iudge things aright. And likewiſe to ſee and diſcerne them by out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward actions, and the exterior ſences. The eye, the foote, the hand, ſhall not wag, moue, or ſtirre, but it ſhal diſcouer the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward thought. Laſtly, it is it's proper office, (Reaſon aſſiſting and the diſcourſe of the vnderſtanding) to anticipate occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and to diuert in time the euill that may happen; For, (as <hi>Tully</hi> ſayth, and very truly) <hi>Nihil turpius in ſapiente eſt, quam dicere, non putaram:</hi> Nor ought it to be the Language of kings to ſay; I did not thinke on ſuch a thing, I did not dreame, that things would haue fallen out thus, &amp; thus; or that I did not throughly vnderſtand the buſines. For, in Kings, it is no leſſe ſhame to ſuffer themſelues to be deceiued, or to be ouercome by Artes, and tricks, then to be ſubdued in the open field by force of Armes. Kings therefore, being neceſſarily to heare, and negociate with ſo many and ſo ſundry perſons, to free themſelues from the ſlightes &amp; ſubtleties of ſome, muſt make vſe of this circumſpection and ſagacitie. <hi>Homer</hi> repreſenteth vnto vs a moſt prudent Prince, who (though vnlearned) yet for that he was very crafty &amp; ſubtile, did gouerne very well, and freed himſelfe from many great dangers. Subtletie and Sagacity, accompanied (I ſay) with a ſound intention, and a good conſcience, (for that is it, wee aime at in gouernment) proceedeth not from ſagacity, and ſubtletie, but from good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and Iuſtice.</p>

                  <p>But to come to the point; Let the firſt point of aduiſe and diſcretion in a King be; not to truſt ſo much to his owne wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome and diſcretion, as to forbeare, out of a preſumption of his owne ſufficiencie, to treate and conſult buſineſſes with perſons of prudence and vnderſtanding. For, being that ſo many and ſo various are the caſes, which daily offer them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues vnto Kings, and ſo graue and weightie the buſineſſes, whereof they treate, they muſt bee canuaſed to and fro, and well and throughly debated, for the better ordering and ſetling of them; making former errours, to ſerue as Land-markes, for the auoyding of thoſe to come. And like a wiſe and experienced Phyſitian, let him apply that medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine there, and in that caſe, where, for want thereof hee had formerly erred.

<pb n="271" facs="tcp:180809:146"/>
now, and thoſe of olde, for (as <hi>Cornelius Tacitus</hi> ſaith, who was a ſingular Maſter in this ſcience, ſpeaking of his owne times, in reſpect of the former) the men are other, but not their manners. They are now, as they were then; and then as now. Well may it be, that for ſome conſiderations, men may repreſſe, and couer their affections more at one time, then another, but not, that they are not one and the ſame, thoſe of this time and that; and that early or late they doe not the ſame worke, they antiently did. For, from one and the ſame cauſes, it muſt neceſſarily follow, that we muſt ſee one and the ſame effects. Let Kings therefore ſee (once more I ſpeake it) and conſider well the eſtate wherein ſtand the affaires of their Kingdome, how it is in the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernment, in their Miniſters, and their Counſellours, what their affections, naturall inclinations, paſſions, ambitions, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires, and the like, and make a iudgement of the one and the other, of the preſent, and the paſt, and they ſhall finde, that theſe, and thoſe, great &amp; ſmall, and all one with another tread in one and the ſame ſteps, and ayme all at that faire white, of their owne black and fowle Intereſt. And weighing likewiſe with themſelues, that ſome, if not moſt of thoſe Kings and Monarkes, that haue gone along in that track and held the like courſe of gouernment, and made vſe of the like Miniſters, either haue beene ruined thereby, or brought neere vnto it, let them ſtand aloofe from it, or them, or ought elſe whatſoeuer whereby they may either ſee, or know, other their predeceſſours haue beene vtterly ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throwne. For, moſt certaine it is, that by the effects of Caſes paſt, we may know what were the cauſes of them; and how in the like, the like may likewiſe ſucceede. The ſcience and knowledge of Kings, is like vnto that of <hi>Aſtro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logie,</hi> wherein are better skill'd thoſe of latter then former times, in regard of thoſe many proofes and experiences, which they haue ſeene, heard, and read. Hiſtorie therefore and experience, being the fountaines of humane wiſedome,
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:180809:147"/>
Princes ought to peruſe Hiſtories, and procure to know how it hath ſucceeded with others, that thereby they may take aduice and warning in caſes to come; and from this experience and knowledge of mens naturall inclinations and affections, to draw thence a doctrine, for to moderate their owne, and to know other mens diſpoſitions, and withall, to take notice, that the naturall diſpoſitions of the men of theſe times, are not more ſtrong and able to reſiſt their ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petites, but are more weake in the naturall, and leſſe perfect in the ſpirituall, then thoſe of our Anceſtors. Whence that followeth, which wee ſaid before, that by the Knowledge of the paſt, wee may prognoſticate of the preſent, if wee haue once ſeene, and made triall, that it fell out ſo with o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther men of the like ſtate, and condition. So that it may be collected, by what hath hitherto beene deliuered, how neceſſarie it is, that a King, or ſupreme Lord, ſhould exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe himſelfe for ſome few yeeres, in the ſtudie of the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Lections of Hiſtories, and may (if he will) come by them, to know the cuſtomes, and inclinations of forraigne nations, as well of thoſe, that are free States, as thoſe that are vnder ſubiection; with whom he muſt indure ſo many demaunds, and Anſweres. To the end that the varietie of Accidents, may no whit afflict, nor trouble him. For it were a kinde of diſparagement to a great Prince, to admire any noueltie whatſoeuer, or to ſeeme a ſtranger, to the ſtrangeſt Accidents, that ſhall occurre vnto him. And hee muſt ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily ſuffer this, and other great inconueniences and deceits in matters of State, if hee be not well aduanced in the knowledge of them, and with the people, with whom hee is to treat. For many are they, that pretend to deceiue him, and will not ſuffer the truth to come to his eares in it's naked nature, but ſhadowed with ſome colour, as ſhall make beſt for their pretenſion. For to cut off which miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefe, hiſtories ſerue the turne, which ſupply the want of experience, and ſet before his eyes in a ſhort peece of paper
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:180809:147"/>
the ſucceſſes of an age ſo large and of ſuch a length, that many liues cannot reach thereunto. A thing very neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry in Kings, whereby to finde themſelues prepared for the preſent, and prouided for the future. For hee, that hath ſtill before his eyes what is paſt, is ſeldome deceiued in that which is to come. And hee, that ſhall turne ouer the Hiſtories of former times, ſhall meete with the nouelties of the preſent; as alſo with thoſe truths which Sycophants conceale, and ſuch as are not flatterers dare not to tell him. Onely Hiſtories, without feare or dread, ſpeake plaine language to Kings, and yet remaine as whole, ſound, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire, as they were before.</p>
                  <p>Another point of Diſcretion, is; That for as much as the aduice and wiſdome, and more particularly in Kings and perſons of great name and ranke, is great, they ſhould not intermeddle in ſmall matters, nor ſhew themſelues in your leſſer occaſions, where the glory is none, and the loſſe of reputation great, not onely if they be ouercome, but alſo if they doe not ouercome to their great aduantage. They ought not likewiſe lightly and without very good ground to thruſt themſelues into buſineſſes of great conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, and of that danger and difficultie, that they ſhall not afterwards know well how to winde themſelues out of them: For it argues but a ſmall talent of wiſedome, to know dangers then onely, when a man is in the midſt of them: And ſauours of much leuitie, to put himſelfe deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perately vpon caſes of aduenture. And this is no other Counſayle, then that which a very graue and wiſe man, gaue the Emperour <hi>Veſpaſian,</hi> deſeruing to be written in letters of gold, and in the Cabbinies of Kings. <hi>Qui magnarum rerum conſilia ſuſcipiunt, aeſtimare debent,</hi>

or no for the common-wealth, honourable for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, or whether it may eaſily be effected, or at leaſt with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any great difficultie? And this is a Lecture, which <hi>Chriſt</hi> reades vnto all, aduiſing vs, that before wee begin any buſines of importance, wee enter into an account and reckoning with our ſelues, whether wee bee able to goe through with it, or noe, and when hauing well weighed the difficulties, dangeres and expences wee muſt bee at, wee ſhall finde it to be of more charge then profit, to let it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone. So ſhall wee rid our ſelues of a great deale of care, and excuſe the murmurings and cenſure of the people, who will much riſent it, that in buſineſſes, wherein the wealth, peace, and reputation of a Kingdome is intereſſed, Kings ſhould aduenture for the gaining of a little, to put themſelues in hazard of looſing much. As likewiſe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe thereby is giuen occaſion, of meaſuring the extent and limits of the power of Kings, and of plainely mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſting to the open view of the world, that they cannot alwayes doe what they would nor againſt whom they will, and therefore muſt not giue way, that men ſhould en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into iudgement, that their power cannot reach whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they themſelues will haue it, but ought alwayes and by all meanes they can, to maintaine the credite and eſtima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of their power, and greatneſſe. The words of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour <hi>Chriſt,</hi> are theſe; Which of you diſpoſed to build a Tower,<note place="margin">Luk. 14.</note> ſitteth not downe before, and counteth the coſt, whether he haue ſufficient to performe it? Leſt after hee hath laid the foundation, and is not able to goe through with it, all that behold him, begin to mock him, ſaying; This man began to builde, and was not able to make an end. Or what King going to make warre againſt another King, ſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth not downe firſt, and caſteth in his minde, whether hee be able with ten thouſand to meete him, that commeth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him with twenty thouſand, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>The like I ſay of competitions, whether this, or that other
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:180809:148"/>
doth this, or that better? Though it be in matters of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creation. For all occaſions of incounters with Kings are in any hand to be avoyded. And it likewiſe ſeemeth ill in point of policie, that they in any kinde ſhould haue any competition with their vaſſalls.<note place="margin">Poru. 20.3.</note> And King <hi>Salomon</hi> ſets it downe for a point of policie; for that it is a thing vnwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy authoritie Royall. It is a mans honour (ſaith he) to keepe himſelfe from ſtrife. <hi>Alexander</hi> the Great, being askt the queſtion, whether he would goe and ſport himſelfe at the Olympick games with the reſt of the Great ones of his Court? made anſwere; yes, if there were other Kings with whom I might contend.</p>
                  <p>Yet would I not haue Kings ſo farre to miſtake mee, as to vnderſtand that they may not enterpriſe great things, and haue competence with others, that are as great, or greater then themſelues, following their ſtepps and imita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting their heroycall Actions; nay, it is a point rather of Diſcretion, and wiſedome, in a prudent King, to tread in the track of their Anceſtors, that walked in the right way, and to ſet before their eyes the good things that they did, that according thereunto they may take the like reſolution in the like Caſes. The <hi>Romanes</hi> were ſo religious in the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedents and Examples of their Predeceſſours, that they made them the line and rule of all their Actions, and made them as a Law to be kept and obſerued, and could not depart ther-fro without the fowle note of ignominie, gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning new enterpriſes, by former old Actions. Neither ought a King likewiſe to eſteeme ſo meanely and ſo baſely of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, as to thinke, that hee is not able to doe as much as others haue done in times paſt. For if they of olde, had had that minde and conceit of themſelues, in calling to minde the braue and noble deedes, which they haue either heard, or read in Hiſtories of their Anceſtours, they would not haue imitated them, as many of them haue, in their great and glorious Acts. And certaine it is, that neuer any man
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:180809:149"/>
did any ſuch illuſtrious and heroycall Action heeretofore, which might not be done by another. And therfore, the Actions of Kings being ſuch, as conduce to the ſeruice of God and the well-fare of the Common-wealth, it will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uene very well (the ſaid circumſtances being duly conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red) to commence and giue a beginning vnto them, to the end that fortune, or (to ſay better) God, putting a helping hand to our good diligence and induſtrie, may giue vnto them a full and perfect end. It was the ſaying of King <hi>Ageſilaus:</hi> That fortune, in great affayres, and high en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpriſes, neuer ſhew'd her ſelfe liberall and generous, but when ſhee met with noble and generous mindes. And it hath beene often ſeene, that men looſe, at leaſt let ſlip, many things, not becauſe they are not able to atcheiue them, but becauſe they want courage to vndergoe them. And let them not onely content themſelues with the bare reading of them, but endeuour to be like thoſe famous Captaines, in matter of warre; thoſe great Common-wealthes, in matter of gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; and thoſe Chriſtan Politicians, in matter of State. For examples perſwade much. And albeit that <hi>Homer</hi> ſaith, that great enterpriſes are ſooner ſpoken of, then done; eaſily vttered, but hardly executed, yet let Princes doe their beſt, which will be no ſmall matter. For thereby, their ſubiects will receiue benefit, their ſucceſſors beare them enuie, and their enemies ſtand in feare of them.</p>
                  <p>Now let vs draw out of this diſcourſe that diſcretion, which is a vertue ſo neceſſary, that when it is wanting, good is conuerted into ill; and vertue, into Vice; and where a man thought to winne fame, in ſtead thereof, growes in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>famous, affronted, and aſhamed. For diſcretion, worketh in man that effect, as ſalt doth in fleſh, which dryes vp the moyſture, drawes forth the blood, and keepes it from cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption. As doth ſalte, ſo doth diſcretion, keepe man free from perturbations, or any vnſeemelineſſe and diſcompo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, in any Action whatſoeuer he vndergoeth.

this vertue to his Diſciples,<note place="margin">Mark. 9.49.</note> when hee com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded them to haue ſalte within themſelues. This was in the Goſpell. But long before in the Leuiticall Law,<note place="margin">Leuit. 2.13.</note> it was commanded; that euery Sacrifice, ſhould be ſalted with ſalte.

Giuing vs thereby to vnderſtand the wiſedome and diſcretion, wherewith hee would haue vs to ſerue him. And Saint <hi>Paul</hi> chargeth vs, not to vtter that word which ſhall not be ſeaſoned with the ſalt of wiſdome, and diſcretion. A qualitie very neceſſary and requiſite in all, but more particularly, and without compariſon with much more ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uantage in Kings, as hath wiſely beene obſerued by <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelmus,</hi> and venerable <hi>Bede.</hi> In that ſafe-conduct, which <hi>Artaxerxes</hi> gaue vnto <hi>Eſdras,</hi> wherein was ſet downe in a liſt, all the allowances that they were to make him, and what prouiſions he was to haue along with him,<note place="margin">Eſdras 6.</note> and though in the reſt there was a limitation, <hi>Sal ver ò abſque menſura;</hi> yet was hee to haue ſalte without meaſure. Hee was not ſtinted in that. For in all things belonging vnto Kings, there is ſuch a proportion, taxe, or meaſure ſet vpon them; but there are no bounds, no limitts to be ſet vpon their wiſedome and diſcretion. Let them (a Gods name) haue that without meaſure, without limitation. For, let them haue neuer ſo much, it is no more then they haue neede of. God, of his goodneſſe, giue them as much as is needefull for them, and that ſhall ſuffice them. And let vs extract this, out of all that which hath beene ſaid touching this ſence of ſmel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, that there are two ſorts, or two kindes of prudence, (according to S. <hi>Baſil.</hi>) The one good, and the other bad; The one of fleſh, and blood; and the other of ſpirit, and life. Of the former, doe the wiſe men of this world boaſt. For they denominate that man to be wiſe, that is crafty and
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:180809:150"/>
ſubtill, a ſlye, cunning Companion, that by ouer-reaching, and damnifying his neighbour, procures his owne priuate profit. The one (ſayth Saint <hi>Paul</hi>) kills, the other quickens; This brings death,<note place="margin">Rom. 8.8.</note> that life. <hi>Nam prudentia carnis, mors eſt; prudentia autem ſpiritus, pax &amp; vita:</hi> For, to be carnal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly minded, is death; but to be ſpiritually minded, is life and peace. Let that then be condemned for ill, and let that ſuffice, which hath beene ſpoken thereof. And let vs ſet vp our reſt vpon this, which is ſuch and ſo good, that no vertue with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out it, is pleaſing and acceptable vnto God, as no Sacrifice was without ſalte. So that chaſtitie, and cleanneſſe it ſelfe, a vertue ſo high prized by God, and allianced ſo neerely with the Angels, is of no reckoning without prudence. And that his beſt beloued,<note place="margin">Mat. 25.</note> beautifulleſt, and faireſt Spouſe, ſhould ſhee be wanting in this, he would repudiate her, and abhorre her.

It doth not onely put mans reaſon and will in the right way, direct his forces and faculties, and order all his actions; but without it, man is no man, but the Counterfaite, and figure of a man. For therein conſiſteth the abſoluteneſſe and perfection of man, and that ſimilitude and likeneſſe, which he hath with God, in his being capable of Reaſon, and prudence. By his Memorie he makes that, which is paſt, preſent; by his wiſedome, he foreſees that which is to come; and by his Counſell and aduiſe, he diſpoſeth and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dereth the preſent eſtate of things, which are thoſe parts of prudence, which we ſpecified before.</p>

It is (as S. <hi>Iſidore</hi> ſaith) a rigorous, a cruell and importunat cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditour; <hi>Nullus hominis tam importunus exactor eſt,</hi>

                  <hi>quàm venter; bodie ſuſcipit, &amp; cras exigit:</hi> There is not any ſo earneſt and eager an Exactor on man, as is the belly; It receiues to day, and requires the ſame againe to morrow. It is continually demaunding that troubleſome tribute of meate and drinke, of recreation and pleaſure, and all other things neceſſary for the body; for all theſe paſſe, and are regiſtred, vnder the ſenſe of the Taſte. Which, albeit it be leſſe noble then the reſt, yet is it more neceſſary then all of them. For (as S. <hi>Ierom</hi> ſayth, and experience teacheth) without it wee cannot liue long, but without the other we may. <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> ſayth, that this ſence directs it's eye to theſe two obiects; to the pleaſure it receiueth in eating, and to the delight it taketh in drinking. Both being very power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, and walking ſtill hand in hand, the one ſeconding the other, taking their ſeuerall turnes. And their <hi>Signorie</hi> ſo farre extends it ſelfe, that it trenches vpon the reſt of the ſences, and all of them are willing to accompaine him. For Hearing, Seeing, and Smelling, neither like vs, nor laſt long, vnleſſe they haue the fellowſhip of the Taſte. Yet are they
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:180809:151"/>
differenced in this, that the <hi>Species</hi> of thoſe things, that are to be ſeene, heard, and ſmelt, are to paſſe by the <hi>Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um,</hi> or meanes of another kinde of tranſparent body, as is the Ayre. Whereas thoſe that are to be taſted, are to touch immediatly vpon the tongue, and to haue their dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling and abiding in the palate, that it may the better reliſh &amp; diſtinguiſh the ſeuerall ſorts of Taſtes. And it is worthy our obſeruation, that in that part of the Head, which is the mouth, where principally the Taſte hath it's ſeate, though it's Iuriſdiction be ſo ſhort, and ſo curtall'd, that it ſcarce occupieth the leaſt ſpace of the Tongue, and that it's de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light is ſo ſhort, that it indureth but for a moment, yet it ſhould come to be of that power and force, that it forced the wiſe man to ſay; That it was inſatiable. And though it alwayes hath, and doth ſtill ſhew it's rule and Empire ouer all mortall men, yet does it make it's greateſt oſtenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in Kings, in Princes, and your great and principall per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, who are moſt ſubiect to it's Command. Some com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare it to the fire, whereinto the more fuell you fling, the more infinite is it's power, and reſts neuer ſatisfied. In like manner, ſuch a Tyrant is the Taſte, that be our riches, rents and patrimonies neuer ſo great, like fire, it waſtes and conſumes them, though it ſelfe remaine ſtill whole and intire, without being leſſened or diminiſhed. Nor will I heere cite the Examples of prophane Kings and Emperours giuen ouer to the pleaſure of their palate and ſenſuall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights, to the loſſe of great Eſtates and Kingdomes, and the ſcandall of their ſubiects; becauſe my purpoſe is to quote ſome places of the ſacred Scripture, dictated by the Holy Ghoſt, the Author of Truth. It is reported of King <hi>Salo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon,</hi> that being ſo wiſe, ſo rich, and ſo powerfull a Prince, that hee did in ſuch ſort let looſe the reines to his vnbri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dled appetite, as if there were not the leaſt footing of wiſedome, or reaſon to be found in him. Hee himſelfe ſays as much in <hi>Eccleſiaſtes,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Eccl. 2.1.</note> where (as one that ſaw at laſt his

I ſayd ſo, and as I ſayd, ſo I did. <hi>Vadam;</hi> I will goe; That is to ſay, after my appetite, I will abound in wealth, I will inioy the good things of this world, by which are vnderſtood all ſortes of delights, and pleaſures, as eating, drinking, intertainments, recreations, ſportes, and paſtimes, and whatſoeuer in that kinde may be conceiued or imagined.<note place="margin">Eccl. 2.10.</note>

                  <hi>vt ego:</hi> Who, of all the Kings that euer were in the world, could eate more then I? Or who could haſten more thereunto then I, hauing the world ſo much at will, and more then all they had? Was it not a thouſand pities (thinke you) to ſee ſo wiſe a King to become Tributary and ſubiect to ſo vile a ſlaue as is the belly? I haue of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten times muſed and wondred with my ſelfe at the blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of our noble men of theſe times, who making it ſuch a point of honour, and ſtanding ſo ſtrictly vpon it, not to pay any taxe, or tribute, though it amount not to aboue a blanke, and that they will ſooner looſe their liues, then acknowledge themſelues Tributaries, and yet that theſe the more noble and greater Lords they are, ſhould the more glory to be Tributaries, and render and ſubmit themſelues moſt, to this infamous tribute, and tyrannicall taxe, which is payd to the palate? What ſumptuous tables? What coſtly diet? What dainty diſhes? What exquiſite curioſities? What rich and precious wines? What <hi>Regalos?</hi> And what recreations, more befitting Heathens, then Chriſtians? And all, for to pay the Taſte this vnlawfull
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:180809:152"/>
cuſtome? Which in plaine language, is a greater taske, and a greater Tribute, then the pooreſt labourer, or the meaneſt hedger and ditcher is ſeaſſed at. For, when he pays this Tribute, it is onely with a peece of houſhold bread, and a diſh of ſmall drinke, and other the like poore con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentments, denying to his Taſte thoſe exceſſiue Tributes, which your Kings and greater perſons pay, being in this particular better gentlemen then they. O the blindneſſe of our Chriſtian Nobilitie! Let me put this queſtion vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to you; when the Collector of Subſedyes comes to a poore husbandmans houſe, to demand ſo much of him as he is ſeaſſed at, if hee ſhould pay him more then is due vnto him by the Law, or any Act ordained in that kinde, or ſhould be earneſt with him to take more then hee is ſet at, would not all men thinke him to be a foole, and a very ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple fellow? The like errour doe they commit, who con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume their goods, their lands, and their whole Eſtates in ſeruing the belly, and ſatisfying the Taſte with ſuch diuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitie of delicate Viands, and choyſe wines, when as they may well pay this Tribute with that little, or ſmall modi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cum, mentioned by the Apoſtle; <hi>Habentes alimenta, &amp; quibus tegamur,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 Tim. 6.8.</note> 
                  <hi>his contenti ſimus:</hi> Hauing foode, and rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, let vs be therewith contented. And with this, let vs goe dayly redeeming thoſe ſeaſſements and Tributes, which were impoſed vpon vs by ſinne, and in particular this ſinne of eating and drinking, wherewith ſo often euery day we make ſuch large payments. And if wee cannot quit the whole ſcore, let vs doe herein, like your bad payma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, who doe huck and pinch, and pay as little as they can. But this (the more is the pitie) is not in vſe amongſt them. For men, when they are call'd vpon to pay either priuate debts, or publick ſeaſſements, they driue the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander off with delayes, and when they ſhould make pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, fall a caffling, and refuſe to lay downe what is due. But in eating, and drinking, they will pay much more then
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:180809:152"/>
is due, and preſſe the belly to take more, then either it is willing, or able to receiue. When <hi>Caeſars</hi> Collectors came to demand Tribute of our Sauiour <hi>Ieſus Chriſt,</hi> hee put this queſtion to Saint <hi>Peter; Reges terrae, à quibus accipiunt Tributum, vel cenſum? A filijs, an ab Alienis?</hi> The kings of the earth, of whom doe they receiue Tribute? Of the Children, or of ſtrangers? To whom <hi>Peter</hi> anſwered; of ſtrangers. Thereupon our Sauiour perſently replyes, <hi>Ergo liberi ſunt filij:</hi> Therefore the children are free. And if Kings and their children are, and ought to be free from this royall Tribute; it ſtandeth with much more reaſon, that they ſhould be freed (as much as is poſſible) from the Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute of their proper guſts and pleaſures, which is much more preiudiciall vnto them, then that can be, ſhould they pay it. For that payment is made but once a yeare at moſt, or from halfe yeare to halfe yeare, and it is payd in money; But this is daily and howerly, and muſt be payd with a mans wealth, with his Health, with his life, and with his honour. A man cannot lap vp in a little peece of paper the misbehauiours and miſdemeanors which Princes haue fallen into, by giuing themſelues to riotous banqueting, nor the exceſſes, which they haue beene forced to commit, when they haue broke the bounds of Temperance.<note place="margin">Prou. 30.22.</note> There are two things (ſayth the Wiſe man) which diſquieteth the world, and turneth it topſie-turuy;<note place="margin">Prou. 31.4.</note> To ſee a ſlaue when he reigneth; And a foole, when hee is filled with meate. And therefore the ſayd Wiſeman forbiddeth wine vnto Kings. And <hi>Seneca</hi> doth much reproue <hi>Alexander</hi> the Great,<note place="margin">Senec. epiſt. <hi>84.</hi>
                  </note> and <hi>Marcus Antonius,</hi> for their diſtemper in their diet; A thing ſo vnworthy the royall dignitie, that <hi>Cicero</hi> did affirme,<note place="margin">Cicero. Philip. <hi>2.</hi> Orat. <hi>4.</hi>
                  </note> that cruditie of the ſtomack in Princes, was a great indignitie, and altogether vnbeſeeming them. For, by delighting in drinking, they dull their ſpirits, enfeeble their ſtrength, and diſcouer a thouſand weakeneſſes to the world, the concea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling whereof did import them very much, and neerely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:180809:153"/>
them. King <hi>Salomon</hi> ſayth in his <hi>Prouerbs,</hi> Much more ſtrong is that man, which ouercomes himſelfe, and ſubdues his owne affections, then hee that getteth great victories ouer his enemies: Suting with that vulgar ſaying; <hi>Fortior eſt qui ſe, quàm qui fortiſsima vincit moenia.</hi> And therefore, it not ſo much importeth Kings, to conquer others, and to make themſelues Lords of new Prouinces and Kingdomes, as not to become perpetuall ſlaues to their proper guſtes &amp; appetites. For this doth not fit and ſute ſo well with the greatneſſe of their Office, nor is eating in it ſelfe ſo generous an Act, that they ought ſo much to prize and eſteeme it. In the booke of the <hi>Iudges,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Iudg. 9.8.</note> we finde a Parable of the trees, who hauing reſolued with themſelues to chooſe a King, to whom all the reſt ſhould owe homage, they came firſt to the Oliue, afterwards to the Fig-tree, and laſtly to the Vine, intreating them that they would be pleaſed to take the Crowne vpon them, and to raigne ouer them. The firſt anſwered; That he could not leaue his fatneſſe, to goe to be promoted ouer the Trees; The Fig-tree, hee excuſed himſelfe in the like manner, ſaying; Hee could not forſake his ſweetneſſe, and his good fruite, for the inioying of a Crowne; And the Vine, he plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly told them, that he would not leaue his wine, which chee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth God, and Man, to become a King. The purpoſe and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent of Parables, (according to the doctrine of glorious S. <hi>Auſtin,</hi> and other holy Doctors) is, to infold in them the truth. And in this is it giuen Kings to vnderſtand, that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe in their Taſtes and delicious meates, is not compatible with their Eſtate, nor doth it become a Crowne Royall, (that wee may ſay all we can, though we ſomewhat exceede from the obiect of the Taſt) to looſe it's time in pleaſures, and paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times, but that in that very inſtant, wherin Kings take them, they ſhould as ſodainly leaue them; in regard, that they haue ſo many and ſo great buſineſſes committed to their charge, wherein if they ſhould beſtow all their time, they haue ſcarce time enough. Which requiring (ſo much as it doth) the
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:180809:153"/>
aſſiſtance, and obſeruation of kings, if they ſhould miſ-ſpend this time in ſports and intertainements, they muſt of neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitie want time for that which is more neceſſary; &amp; be driuen (conſidering that there is not any thing, that doth cauſe a greater relaxation, and diſtraction in the vnderſtanding, and that more abateth the edge and vigor of graue and weighty conſideration, then ſports, paſtimes, and pleaſing of their owne guſtes and palates) to neglect State-buſineſſes, vnleſſe they will be pleaſed to vſe them ſeldome, and with modera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Inſomuch, that they being to repart and diuide the time betweene themſelues and the Common-wealth, they ſhould ſo employ it, that it might not be wanting vnto them for their buſineſſes, nor ſuper-abound vnto them for their Vices.</p>
               <p>Yet for all this doe not I pretend (it being the leaſt part of my meaning) to take from Kings their intertainments, but rather much deſire that they would take them with modera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and without neglecting buſineſſes of State, and after that they ſhall haue fully cumply'de with the Common-wealths affayres. To the end, that all the world may ſee, that theſe their pleaſures, are not as principall, but acceſſary, and as an <hi>ayuda de coſta,</hi> an ayde and helpe, the better to beare their trouble, &amp; to wade through that weariſomeneſſe, which the continuall aſſiſtance on graue and weighty occaſions, cauſeth. Intertainments and ſports muſt be like vnto ſalt, wherewith if your meate be ſprinckled but a little, and in a moderate kinde of manner, it makes them ſauoury, and ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons them in that good ſort, that they doe not onely reliſh, but digeſt the better and breede better nutriment. But if your band be too heauy, and that you lay on loade (as they ſay) without meaſure, or moderation, it marrs your meate, and makes it ſower and vnſauory. And for mine owne part, I am of opinion, that there was neuer any time, wherein Kings had more cauſe, or greater obligation to moderate their plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, then at this preſent, it being the onely thing that is now
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:180809:154"/>
in requeſt amongſt your great perſons, and the onely talke that paſſeth amongſt them, how they ſhall paſſe the time. My thinkes, that time is here repreſented vnto me, which the Apoſtle Saint <hi>Paul,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">2 Tim. 3.1.</note> inſpired by the Holy Ghoſt, did prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie, &amp; foretell vnto vs; That in the laſt dayes, perillous times ſhall come (which are now wholly and truly ours) wherein men ſhall be louers of their owne ſelues, and their pleaſures, more then louers of God; and ſhall regard more their owne particular then either their neighbour, Iuſtice, or the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon good. In a word, they ſhall take more care to fulfill their luſts and their delights, then to pleaſe God, and therefore ſhall fall into innumerable ſinnes. The Apoſtle Saint <hi>Peter</hi> and Saint <hi>Iude,</hi> doe much indeare the great euills which vſually ariſe from corporall pleaſures, &amp; the terrible chaſticements which are reſerued for thoſe, that giue themſelues ouer vnto them.

What a companie of aggrauating circumſtances did heere precede the ſinne of <hi>Dauid?</hi> It fell out about that time of the yeare when Kings vſed to goe into the field againſt their enemies, and to muſter vp their ſouldiars. But inſtead of going himſelfe in perſon, hee ſent forth his Captaine <hi>Ioab,</hi> with all the choyſe men of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> himſelfe remaining in the meane while ſporting and recreating himſelfe in his princely Pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace. And not thinking on thoſe cares, which ſo dangerous a warre did at that time require, hee roſe one day after dinner from his Table, and went to walke in a gallerie or Tarras, that lay open to the Sunne, and from thence it was his chance to eſpie <hi>Vriahs</hi> wife waſhing and bathing of her ſelfe in a place of the like nature, right ouer againſt him, who likewiſe on her part gaue occaſion to this ſinne, for that her husband being abroad in the warres, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing himſelfe to ſo many troubles and perills, ſhe ſhould take pleaſure in waſhing her hayre, and in the curious decking and dreſſing her perſon in a place, from whence ſhee might be ſo eaſily ſeene.

her. And that he might poſſeſſe her with the more ſafety, and cloake the adulterie the better, and the childe wherewith, all ſhee went, hee gaue order for the making away of her husband; vpon the neck whereof an infinite number of other euills did inſue. When Kings wage warre, and their ſubiects fight their battailes, hazarding therein their liues, or when any other common calamities happen, as of Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine, or Peſtilence, in their Kingdomes, they are not them to follow their pleaſures and intertainments, but to ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaine from them, and to ſhew and make knowen to the world, that they haue a fellow feeling of theſe common euills, and generall afflictions; For ſo did the King of <hi>Niniue,</hi> as ſoone as hee was informed what the Prophet <hi>Ionas</hi> had preached in his Court, threatning them with the puniſhment which God would ſend vpon that Citie. And the holy Scripture ſaith; That the King himſelfe was the firſt man that forſooke his pleaſures, layd his roabe from him, and couered him with ſack-cloath, and ſate in aſhes, and cauſed it to be proclaimed through <hi>Nineue,</hi> ſaying; Let neither man,<note place="margin">Ionah. 3.6.</note> nor beaſt, heard nor flocke taſt any thing; let them not feede, nor drinke water. But let man and beaſt be couered with ſack-cloath, and cry mightily vnto God; yea let them turne euery one from his euill way, and from the violence that is in their hands, &amp;c. And this was the Courſe; that hee tooke for to appeaſe Gods anger. When King <hi>Dauid</hi> heard of the great ſlaughter which the Peſtilence had wrought in his Kingdome, ſorrowing exceedingly, that the Plague was ſo hot amongſt his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and ſhewing, that it grieued his very heart and ſoule, hee cryed out vnto the Lord,<note place="margin">2 King. 24.17.</note> and ſayd, <hi>Ego ſum, qui pec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caui, ego qui iniquè egi &amp;c.

there was ſo great a Famine, and ſo ſore a Dearth in that Kingdome, that two women by conſent did agree to kill their children, and to eate them by turnes. Which the King had no ſooner heard of, but that he was ſo inwardly grieued therewith, that in expreſſion of his ſorrow he rent his garments, (according to the cuſtome of the <hi>Hebrewes</hi> on ſuch like ſad occaſions, and put on ſack-cloath with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in vpon his fleſh;<note place="margin">1 King. 14.43.</note> Becauſe Prince <hi>Ionathan</hi> did but dip the tippe of his rod in the hony-combe, when as his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther King <hi>Saul,</hi> and all his men of warre, were fighting againſt the <hi>Philiſtins,</hi> God was much offended with it.

Here vnto, I firſt of all anſwer, that the reaſon is not alike in a particular perſon, as in a King, and a Common-wealth, which (as wee ſayd before) are to be conſidered and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood, as a body, with it's Head. And as in a mans body, the head doth naturally feele the paine of the arme, the foote, or any other member; So Kings, which are the Heads of the people, are to haue a feeling of their ſubiects miſeries, &amp; to pittie the ill caſe, wherein they at any time are, as if it were their owne. And this was that, which moued the Apoſtle S. <hi>Paul</hi> to ſay; <hi>Quando patitur vnum membrum, compatinutur omnia membra.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 Cor. 12.26.</note> When one member ſuffreth, all the members ſuffer with it. This is that <hi>Trauazon,</hi> or coupling peece of timber in a Common-wealth, and this, both humane policie, and mans naturall diſpoſition, doth re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire, that when we ſee others ſuffer we ſhould ſuffer with them in our common co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>paſſion towards them. And the Law of charitie, goes ſomewhat farther and would ſtretch this obligation to a greater and higher perfection, as was to be ſeene in the ſayd Apoſtle. <hi>Quis infirmatur, et ego non in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmor?</hi>

               <p>Secondly I ſay; That (as before hath beene deliuered by mee) I do not pretend, to debarre Kings and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealths of their pleaſures and recreations; But my deſire is (which I wiſh with all my heart) that they may be ſuch as may be harmeleſſe and vn-offenſiue, with out remordment and ſting of Conſcience, and without the mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muration and notice of the people.

                  <hi>Salomon</hi> ſayes of himſelfe, that he gaue his deſires as much as they could deſire, &amp; that he gaue himſelf ouer to his delights &amp; contents with that freedome and libertie, as ſuted with the greatnes of ſo powerful a king. But that which he got therby, was not the content which he ſought after, but diſtaſte, irke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomnes, wearines, griefe, &amp; vexatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of ſpirit; which he himſelf hath left firmed &amp; ſigned with his own name, for an example not only to all kings, but to all the whole world. <hi>Vidi in omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus vanitatem,</hi>

                  <hi>et afflictionem animi, et nihil permanere ſub ſole:</hi> Behold, all was vanitie, &amp; vexation of ſpirit, and there was no profit vnder the ſunne. Who could more giue themſelues to their delightes, and pleaſures, then thoſe, whom the booke of <hi>Wiſedome</hi> ſpeaketh of, who with ſuch a deale of care and greedineſſe did runne after all the content, that the world could afford? Yet they ſay and confeſſe, that they were ſo vaine and ſo falſe, and ſuch a weariſomneſſe vnto them, that they were quite tyred out with them, and are now in hell for their labour, and ſhall continue there for euer.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, I ſay; That to the end our ſports and intertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments may be the more pleaſing vnto vs, it is fit that they ſhould be vſed with much moderation, and very ſeldome. Feaſtings and banquetings, when they are too frequent and too ordinary, they cauſe a wearineſſe, and loathing; And as the glorious S. <hi>Ambroſe</hi> wiſely ſaith, <hi>Gratiores poſt famem epulae fiunt, quae aſsiduitate viluerant:</hi> Feaſtings pleaſe moſt after faſting, which by aſſiduitie and continuance grow into contempt. And here by the way occaſion may be taken, to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſe kings of the remedy which they ought to apply in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of Playes &amp; Interludes, as wel in the quality of that which is repreſented, as in the requency wherewith they are vſed; Comedies being now as common as our meate &amp; drinke. But I ſee, that that ſucceedeth now, which did in thoſe more ancient times; Which though they were often ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed out of <hi>Rome,</hi> yet the times altering, they came to be introduced and brought in again. And King <hi>Philip</hi> the ſecond
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:180809:158"/>
who is now in glory, in the latter yeares of his raigne did wholy prohibite them, and for the better furthering of this his determination, he had many, and thoſe very effectuall reaſons for it. And that which of late hath beene obſerued, is, That neuer in any time, hath there beene ſeene ſo much looſeneſſe and ſhameleſneſſe in youth, as ſince the time, they haue beene dayly permitted to be playd and repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented on the ſtage, and in thoſe places, where is the greateſt Audience, there is the greateſt diſſoluteneſſe of manners, eſpecially among your younger ſort of people; For thoſe their words, Accents, Tunes, Songs, wanton carriage of the body, idle geſtures, and actions, performed with ſo much artifice and cunning, is no other thing (as the Prophet ſayd) but to ſow tares, and vicious weedes in good ground, whence they ought with much care to be rooted out. And very blinde is that man, which doth not ſee the danger that there is, in prouoking and ſtirring vp wanton blood, with ſuch laſciuious behauiour, being able enough of it ſelfe to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waken the appetite of ſenſualitie. Euen thoſe diſhoneſt pictures, which neither ſpeake, nor moue, doe catch and lay hold on our eyes, and dragge the Soule after them, eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, if they be drawen to the life, and haue the true poſtures and expreſſions of a wanton woman. Queſtionleſſe, they cannot chooſe but leaue a liuely impreſſion in the Soule. And I know not (I confeſſe) what worke of pietie, or of charitable Almes for Hoſpitalls, (to which vſe a great part of the Stage-Players gaynes goe) can recompence this harme. For of more weight and moment, is one ſinne of theirs, which is there committed; then all the Almes that are giuen throughout the whole world. And we know, it is the Apoſtles rule, That we are not either to doe, or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit an euill, that good may come thereof. And that which I know is; That they which enter in there, doe not come thither to giue an Almes, but for thoſe ends and purpoſes, which haue beene ſufficiently deliuered and reprehended,
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:180809:159"/>
by many holy Doctours, and famous Preachers. Nor doth it boote them to ſay; That the people, that ſpend their time in ſeing of Comedies, are there met together to ſee a harme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe Interlude. Which were they not ſhut vp in that open Aſſembly, would perhaps be wandring abroad, committing worſe ſinnes, which by this Intercourſe are excuſed; for in this one particular, in this very thing, is it plainely to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued, how bad Playes be, ſince for their defence, they haue neede of the fauour of avoyding a greater euill. And in realitie of truth, they doe not excuſe, or diuert ſinnes, but ſinnes are there rather learned, the ſpectators carrying them away with them conceiued in their minds, by the ones vaine apprehenſion, and the others fowle and wanton repreſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and anon after, bring forth monſtrous birthes. And in very truth, the troubles, and temporall ſcourges, of warre, famine, and peſtilence; the many Cities that are battred and beaten downe to the ground, and deſtroyed; the perſecuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and the continuall wants and neceſſities of theſe King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes, doe not require ſo many, and ſuch contents, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioycings;<note place="margin">Eccl. 22.6.</note> 
                  <hi>Muſica in luctu, importuna narratio,</hi> ſaith the Holy Ghoſt; Muſick in mourning, is as a tale out of ſeaſon. Beſides, we are to vnderſtand, that God ſendeth theſe his ſcourges, that wee may feele his ſtripes, and repent, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend our ſinfull liues. And therefore the Prophet <hi>Eſay,</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſenteth the wrath which God had conceiued againſt his people, becauſe they were not ſenſible of his chaſticements. <hi>Et non eſt reuerſus ad percutientem ſe, et Dominum non inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fierunt:</hi> The people turneth not vnto him that ſmiteth them, neither doe they ſeeke the Lord of Hoſtes. Haue yee ſeene the like dullneſſe in any nation?

That mirrour of Wiſdome, King <hi>Salomon,</hi> or (to ſay better) the Holy Ghoſt ſpeaking by him; Our Sauiour <hi>Ieſus Chriſt,</hi> the true wiſedom of his father, and that great Biſhop and Doctor of the Church, S. <hi>Gregorie,</hi> plainely tell vs, That thoſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights and merriments, which are ſo well receiued in the world, are but lyes, and mocks, and prognoſtications of euils to come; and that they haue their reception and reſidence in the hearts of fooles, and that they remaine baniſhed from thoſe, that are truly wiſe. Theſe Authenticall perſons haue ſayd it, and all the Saints of God haue confirmed the ſame, both by example, and doctrine. And I, whileſt I am now writing of this ſubiect (though the meaneſt of a thouſand) am verily perſwaded, that my pen cannot doe better ſeruice, then to iuſtifie Gods cauſe, and to make the faults of Kings the more without excuſe, and to let the mighty know, that they ſhall be mightily puniſhed.

This is the Maſter-key, (as we may tearme it) and the ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Miſtreſſe of Nature, which by the helpe of one onely Inſtrument, performeth diuerſe Offices; As of the Ayre, to refrigerate and coole the heart, to refreſh and comfort it, and to make it breathe the better and with the more eaſe, and likewiſe, to forme our words, for without it, it is as

impoſſible to ſpeake, as without breath to winde a Horne, or blow to play vpon the Fife; The tongue ſerues vs for our taſte, it ſerues to turne and roll our meate vp and downe in our mouth; it ſerues to cleanſe the roofe there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, gumm's and teeth, it ſerues vs to talke withall, and to vtter thoſe conceits, which are hatched in the braine, which is it's moſt proper Office; And though it be written of ſome, that they haue ſpoken without a tongue, yet this is the vſuall meanes of vtterance, and the ordinary inſtrument wherwith we pronounce our words, which are the thoughts Interpreters. I omit here to treate, of good, or better language, or whether this, or that, ought to be in greateſt requeſt, ſince the Maſter himſelfe of Eloquence ſaith;<note place="margin">Cicero Tuſc. lib. <hi>2.</hi>
                     </note> That in euery part, and place, wee are to ſpeake with thoſe words, which are there vnderſtood; And that ſuch a people, or ſuch a Nation, is Lord of a Language, and may by a kinde of prerogatiue power, either coyne new, or call in old words. It being like vnto money of ſeuerall Kingdomes, and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uinces, that being currant in one Countrie, which will not paſſe in another. And therefore that language, ought to be ſpoken by vs, which is generally approued, and common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly vſed and receiued. And therefore many times men alter the faſhion of their Language, as they do of their cloathes. And wee our ſelues finde, that in this our <hi>Spaniſh</hi> tongue, wee haue made almoſt as many changes and alterations, as we haue of our garments, and are able to make two ſuch different languages, that the one ſhould not vnderſtand the other. For, wee make ſuch haſt to inuent new words, and to take them vpon loane from other Languages, that thinking thereby to inrich it, we come to looſe and forget our own naturall Language. So different is it (to ſome mens ſeeming) in theſe, from what it was informer times. For the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> tongue in it ſelfe, is an humble and lowly language, if they had not painted it ouer and adulterated it with new words; Not conſidering in the meane while with themſelues, that
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:180809:162"/>
the beſt Language (according vnto <hi>Tully</hi>) is that, which wee haue beene taught by our Mothers, and which chaſte Matrones, and thoſe that haue beene well bred, ſpeake ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliarly at home in their owne houſes. And the reaſon of it, is, for that they hauing not gone abroad out of their owne Countrie, to forraine nations, not treated and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſed with ſtrangers, they conſerue the naturall phraſe and ſpeech of their own Towne, or Country, without ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phiſticating their Language with new words, or thoſe that are not of ordinary vſe. And therefore it is fitting, that wee ſhould ſpeake in that, which is moſt paſſable, and which is beſt vnderſtood, vſing ſober, proper, and plaine words; for words were ordayned to that end, that they might be well vnderſtood. He ſpeakes beſt, and in the beſt Language, that is beſt vnderſtood; not hee, that ſhall ſpeake in an vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couth ſtile, and in words that are neither in vſe, nor eaſie to be vnderſtood. It is a common ſaying with vs; <hi>Delos antiquos, auemos de imitar las virtudes, y delos modernos, el Lenguaje:</hi> Wee are to imitate the ancient in their ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues: and the Moderne, in their Language.

Many moe therebe, which ſpeak much in matter of tongues, and languages, vſed throughout the world. But I will onely treate of thoſe, which imports Kings, and Kingdomes. Such as is that truth and ſinceritie, wherewith they are to treate, that faith and word, which they are to cumply with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, and that ſecret, which they are to keepe. Two things (ſayth <hi>Pythagoras</hi>) did the moderate men of the earth, receiue from heauen, well worthy our conſideration, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of the great fauour done them therein; The one, that they ſhould haue the power to be able to doe good vnto others; And the other, to treat Truth. And that in them they ſhould hold competition with the Gods. Properties, both of them well befitting Kings. Of the power, that
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:180809:162"/>
Kings haue, to doe good vnto their friends, and to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend themſelues from their enemies, wee haue already ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified vnto you, how proper it is to the greatneſſe of a King, and how like therein hee is vnto God.

                     <hi>Non decet Principem labium mentiens:</hi> Lying lipps, becometh not a Prince. It is the ſaying of a King; and of a King, that was a <hi>Salo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon,</hi> who ſpake with the tongue of the Holy Ghoſt; and it is an avouched and ratified Concluſion, that the pen and the tongue of a King, ſhould alwayes tell the truth, though it were againſt himſelfe: As likewiſe for to teach, and inſtruct his ſubiects that they doe the like; as alſo all others, that ſhall treate with them. For in vaine doth hee deſire to heare truth, that will not deale truly; And per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happs for this cauſe, the ſhorteſt of all other your words in allmoſt all Languages, are your Yea, and Nay. There can be no ſhifting, or doubling in them; no going about the buſh. Theſe words will admit no other conſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on but a bare affirmation, or negation. In the feweſt words are the leaſt falſehood; and the leaſt quarrell to be pick't againſt them. Men cannot expatiate their excuſes, as they may where larger Language is vſed. And therefore the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, as it is the ſhorteſt, ſo it is the ſureſt way. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Kings ought all wayes, and in all, and with all, to treate truth; being that it may be vttred with ſo much eaſe and facility, and to ſuffer himſelfe to be plainely vnderſtood; Contrary to the Tenent of a ſort of vp-ſtart Hereticks,
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:180809:163"/>
which theſe Times tearme Politicians, who for to make good their Policie, and Tyrannicall gouernment, affirme; That a King may, for reaſon of State, if hee ſee it may make for the conſeruation thereof, Diſſemble, deceiue, breake his word, and plight his faith, without any purpoſe or meaning to keepe it; fraud, diſſimulation, and deceit, of what con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition ſoeuer it be, being contrary vnto truth, and contrary to the Law of nature, which in all that it treates, requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth truth; and contrary to the Diuine Law, which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demneth him, that ſpeakes not the truth, but goes about to deceiue. And our Sauiour <hi>Chriſt,</hi> calls King <hi>Herod</hi> Foxe, reprouing his wily ſhifts, and deepe diſſimulations, and more particularly, in putting on a face of ſorrow before his Gueſtes that he feaſted, when he commanded <hi>Iohn Baptiſt's</hi> head to be ſmitten off, it being the onely thing that hee moſt deſired.

Therefore a Chriſtian King, or his Miniſter may ſilence ſome things, caſt a cloake ouer them, and not ſuffer themſelues to be vaderſtood, and cunningly to diſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:180809:163"/>
that, which they know of them, as long as they ſhall thinke it neceſſary to be kept cloſe and ſecrete, for the good expedition of that which is in Treaty; But a King, or his Miniſter may not faigne, deceiue, diſſemble, or to giue that to be vnderſtood by any open Act of his, which he had not in his heart and boſome to doe. All which hath no place in that, which appertaineth vnto Faith, wherein, by the Law of God, we haue obligation, not onely to beleeue, but alſo to confeſſe, with all truth and plainneſſe, that which we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue, without giuing to vnderſtand, by the leaſt word, or geſture, ought to the contrary; nor for the leaſt moment of time, though thereby we might ſaue our liues. Whereby, Kings, and Chriſtian Miniſters are admoniſhed, how they may vſe diſſimulation, how farre, and for what time, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out treading in the path of their priuate profit, through which your Politicians pretend to leade them, leauing the high way of Truth, wherewith accordeth whatſoeuer is iuſt and right, &amp; ſhunneth all manner of lying, which Truth and Time will at laſt bring to light. It was the ſaying of King <hi>Theopompus;</hi> That kingdomes, and great Eſtates, were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerued by Kings ſpeaking Truth, and by ſuffring others to ſpeake the Truth vnto them. For, they being thoſe, whom it moſt importeth to heare truths, none heare leſſe. King <hi>Antiochus,</hi> all the time of his raigne, ſayd; that he did not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member, that euer hee had heard any more then one only truth. It being the plague of Kings and Princes to haue that verified in their Pallaces and Courtes, which was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuered by <hi>Democritus, Quod veritas in profundo puteo demerſa latet:</hi> That Truth lyes buryed in a deepe pit. You ſhall ſcarce meete with one in an Age, that dare tell Kings the Truth, there being ſo many about them, that ſooth them vp with lyes and flatteries. <hi>Seneca</hi> ſaith; That of ten hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred thouſand ſouldiers, which <hi>Artaxerxes</hi> had in his Army, there was but one onely that told him the truth in a caſe wherein all the reſt did lye. And amongſt innu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merable
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:180809:164"/>
Prophets, which concealed the truth from the king, only <hi>Michab</hi> made bold to tell it him. And only <hi>Solon</hi> did the like with king <hi>Croeſus.</hi> Seldom times doth the truth enter into the Kings priuy chamber, and when it enters, they ſcare expreſſe it in that bare and naked maner as did <hi>Iohn Baptiſt.</hi> And for this cauſe, did <hi>Demetrius</hi> the <hi>Philoſopher</hi> wiſh king <hi>Ptolomie,</hi> to reade bookes &amp; Hiſtories, which treated of Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts for Kings, and Captaines, for they would tell him that which none durſt deliuer vnto him. <hi>Socrates</hi> ſayd; That there was notany one, that made open proteſtation to ſpeake the truth, that attained (as he did) to the age of 70. yeares. And certaine it is, that Kings cannot indure to heare thoſe plaine and naked truths, which the common people, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther their ſubiects are able to tel them, and proue vnto them; nor muſt they that are in place preſtume to vtter them, for feare of indangering their authoritie, and reputation; And therefore it is fit, that they ſhould haue ſome ſuch perſons about them, which ſhould both heare, and vnderſtand them, and take their time to informe them of them. And this is a rul'd, Caſe, taken out of thoſe great Inſtructions, and wiſe <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phoriſmes,</hi> which <hi>Mecaenas</hi> gaue to <hi>Auguſtus,</hi> worthy to be taken notice of, and to be kept and obſerued, as com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from ſo great a Counſailour, and propoſed to a Prince, who was ſo wiſe in this kinde. To wit; That Kings, ought to giue libertie and way, that their ſubiects vpon occaſion might be admitted to tell them the Truth, aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring them on their part, that they will not bee offended with that which they ſhall ſay vnto them. For, it is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted vnto a Phyſician to preſcribe corraſiues, and to cut a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way the dead fleſh till it come to the quicke; And it may as well be lawfull for a good ſubiect, a faithfull Miniſter and Counſeller of ſtate, to ſpeake freely vnto his King with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect and reuerence to their royall dignitie) the truth of that they thinke, and to condemne him in his iudgement, or otherwiſe, when he ſhall goe about to doe any thing contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:180809:164"/>
to iuſtice, and reaſon. Nor ought this to ſeeme offenſiue to any man, nor to the King himſelfe, who (if he haue a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian feeling) will approue in his minde &amp; vnderſtanding the reaſons that they ſhall repreſent vnto him; ſo that if he be wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to heare the truths they ſhall tel him, it may turne much to his profit. And if he like not well of it there is no harme done, neither doth he receiue any preiudice by it. And if he ſhall thinke it fit for the furthering of his ends to follow the Counſaile of any, let him co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mend, &amp; honour that perſon. For by that plot, which he ſhall haue deuiſed, &amp; inuented, he ſhall gaine honour and greatneſſe by it. And it is meete &amp; conue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient, that he ſhould incourage both him, and others with thankes, and rewards. Becauſe this is the ſunne, which giues life, and the heate, which warmes good wits, and makes them actiue, &amp; nimble. And in caſe he ſhall not admit of his aduiſe, let him not diſgrace him, nor finde fault with him for his good will, and the deſire that he hath to do him ſeruice. But like a great Prince (wherein he ſhall ſhew his goodneſſe) let his eye rather looke on the good deſire and affection where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with he doth it, then on the effect thereof; As likewiſe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe others may not be diſheartned, for there is not any the pooreſt plante, that hath not ſome vertue in it; nor any brayne ſo barrene, whence at one time or other ſome fruite may not be gathered for the publicke good.</p>
                  <p>I conclude then this firſt point of that plaine and ſincere truth, which Kings are to treate, and wherewith they are to be treated, in ſignifying vnto them, that their own and the Kingdomes ſafety relyes on ſearching out the truth, and in hauing thoſe about them which will freely ſpeake it (a thing ſo neceſſarie for to gouerne vprightly) and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward him (though it coſt him well) that ſhall tell him. For Kings ſhall meete with few, that will tell it them (as they ſay) for a ſong. For, conſidering the danger where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>into they put themſelues by ſpeaking the truth, it coſtes them much. And it is an old and ancient kinde of coſenage
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:180809:165"/>
and deceit, which Kings and Princes ſuffer in not hearing truthes, contenting themſelues with applauſe and adulation of that only which pleaſeth their humour, though it be in things of much importance, and ſuch as neerely concerne them.<note place="margin">Sozomen. Tri. part. lib. <hi>1.</hi> cap. <hi>7.</hi>
                     </note> A notable example whereof, we haue in the Tri-partite Hiſtorie, (reported by <hi>Sozomenus</hi>) of the Emperour <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantine</hi> the great, who being one day deſirous to make triall of the integritie, and truth of thoſe that ſeru'd him, hee called them all before him, and told them; My good friends, it is now many yeares, that I haue liued vnder the obſeruance of the Chriſtian Law, but now I grow weary of it, for it is a very painefull and troubleſome thing to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit our necke to the yoake of the Goſpell and to ſubmit our ſelfe to a Law, that will nor allow vs ſo much liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, as to ſwarue one tittle from it. I pray you, let me haue your opinions in it, for we, for our part, are reſolued what we will doe. When the Emperour had thus expreſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, thoſe that were flatterers &amp; Sycophants, and time plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſers, ſayd vnto him; Wee thinke your Maieſtie ſhall doe well in ſo doing, and wee ſhall be obedient to what you ſhall ordaine therein. But thoſe good and faithfull ſeruants, which deſired the good and proſperous eſtate of their Prince both in ſoule and body, humbly beſought him on their knees, ſaying; Sir For Gods honour, and your own, doe not doe ſo vile a thing, for it is neither fitting, nor law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, nor ſhall wee follow you therein, or ſerue you one day longer. Then did the Emperour know by this, which were good ſeruants, and of greateſt truſt, and preſently diſmiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed the other; <hi>Credens, nunquam eos, circa principem ſuum fore debitos, qui fuerunt Dei ſui fic paratiſsimi proditores:</hi> Perſwading himſelfe, that they would neuer be faithfull to their Prince, that would ſo ſoone turne traytours vnto God. And if Kings would know how true this is, and the errour wherein they liue, by hauing the truth kept from them, let them at ſome one time or other (when they ſee fit) make
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:180809:165"/>
ſhew to affect the contrary to that, which before they were hot vpon, and did earneſtly deſire; and then ſhall they ſee, that thoſe very men, which approued the one, will likewiſe make good the other, and then will they know how in the one, or in the other, nay in all, they are deceiued by them; or at leaſt, that they dare not plainely and ſimply tell him that truth, which their hearts thinke. If they be Miniſters and Counſellours of State, if they once finde out their Kings humour, and the ayre that moſt delightes his care, they play vpon that ſtring: If they be bed-chamber men, or the like familiar Attendants about his perſon, they haue naturally a ſeruile inclination, and make it their common cuſtome to intertaine him with matters of mirth, of iolli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, and intertaynment: if they be his freinds, of his fauourites, they alſo are not without their applauding and adulation, and by ſo much the more to be ſuſpected, by how much the greater it is. But what if all theſe ſhall ioyne to abuſe a good King? Then this miſerie likewiſe comes of it. That what a few of them ſhall begin to ſay, all the reſt will approue it. And if Kings (as they cannot without being knowen) could but heare their talke and conuerſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, they might heare and know many truths, they ſhould know the mindes of many, and the deſires of all, and they would reioyce in knowing the truth of that, which none durſt tell them. For ſome, nay many of them, will report what they heare, and amongſt themſelues ſpeake plainely the truth one to another, ſo as they be ſure that the King cannot heare them. This would be ſomewhat, if not much remedyed, if Kings would but doe that, which we but euen now deliuered of the Emperour <hi>Conſtantine</hi> the Great, who would not ſuffer that Miniſter or Fauourit that hee had once caught in a Lye euer to ſee his face any more, but wholly diſmiſt him from his ſeruices: For both in wiſedome and Chriſtianitie, it is to be preſumed, that in all or alwayes that hee can, at leaſt as oft as it toucheth
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:180809:166"/>
his owne particular, hee will not make him a faithfull rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and liuing in this iuſt iealouſie and ſuſpicion of his truth, and plaine dealing, with much ſcruple of conſcience, and in great danger, doth that King liue which giues him his care, or vpholds him is his office.

                     <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>His word Faith, in our Common Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, ſignifies Credit; And ſometimes Faith, is taken for that beliefe, which wee giue vnto that, which others tell vs. And other whiles, for that, which others giue vnto that, which we tell them. And to ſay, that a man is ſuch a one, is <hi>Hombre de fee,</hi> a man of faith, is all one, as if we ſhould ſay, that he is a man of Credit, and that wee giue faith and credit to that he ſaith <hi>Marcus Tullius,</hi> who knew better then all the Latiniſts beſides, the proper ſignification and elegancie of the Latin words, ſaith: That <hi>fides,</hi> is ſo called, <hi>quaſi fiat, quod dictum eſt,</hi> That faith, hath it's denomination, from not fayling in our word. And hence it is, that men hauing ſhewen themſelues honeſt in doing that which they had paſt their word they would doe, we grew in the end, to giue faith and credit vnto them. And this humane faith, being taken in this ſence, is ſo neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary, that people were not able to liue, nor conuerſe to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, or hold any commerce or traffick, if they ſhould not giue Faith and credit one to another. For the conſeruation whereof, it is very fitting, that euery one ſhould make good his word, by his workes, and to ſee that faithfully perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:180809:166"/>
and indeede, for which hee hath part his honeſt word and promiſe. And by how much the more noble a man is, ſo much the more obligation hee hath, to keepe this his faith and word. And if not, ſee the offence which is taken at it, when men are taxed with this faulte, who are ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied with no leſſe, then with taking away that mans life, that goes about to take away another mans faith and credit, by telling him, hee lyes. And it is a thing much to be laughed at, (or to ſay better much to be lamented) to ſee the great folly and raſh proceeding which paſſeth in this kinde, and concerning this matter for they acknowledging in theſe their Lawes, and Duels, what a great obligation they haue to maintaine this their faith, reputation, and credit, by alwayes ſaying, and treating truth, vpon the very leaſt aſperſion, ſhadowe, or note of falſhood, they riſent it ſo much, that they ſticke not to fall into a worſe ſinne ſuch as is a very Lye it ſelfe, a loude lye, by lying ſo eaſily, and ordinarily, as ſome doe. I aske the queſtion; which is worſe, to bee lame, or crooked, or to ſay ſuch a one is ſo, when as there is no ſuch thing? Certainly, it is much worſe to be ſo, then to be ſayd, to be ſo. And to him, that is not ſo, me thinkes he ſhould make but little reckoning of what they ſay in that kinde; and ſhould rather indeauour to flye from any default in himſelfe, then from the bare opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion and ſhadowe thereof. Now a lye, being a greater ill, and a farre fouler default then all theſe, men fall ſo eaſily thereinto, and make ſo little ſcruple of Lying, and more Lying, vying Lye vpon lye; yea euen thoſe, that will lay downe their life, rather then indure that men ſhould tell them they Lye, though themſelues know they lye, and that they lye not, who tell them they lye, being onely of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended with them, that they will not take a Lye, for a truth; or at leaſt let them goe away with it, without the leaſt reproofe or contradiction, which ingenious natures can hardly indure, eſpecially when they know that they are in
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:180809:167"/>
the right, and the other in the wrong. Certainely, of all other Vices, Lying, is the moſt vnworthy noble and gentle blood. And it is ſuch a Labrinth, that the more a man ſeekes to get out of it, the more he findes himſelfe out of the way. So that a man ſtriuing to get out of one lye, falls into another, and from that to a third, and all of them worſe then the former. Heere I will aduertiſe by the way, that it is a common and vſuall Language with your Courtiers, which may ſeeme to carrye a ſhew of truth, but indeede is full of lyes and falſehood. And this it is: When they will cumply in words, with them who recommend themſelues or their ſuites vnto them, they ſay; Sir vſe you your beſt diligences, for I will doe my part, and God knowes, that I haue, and doe that, which belongs to mee; And true it is; for God knowes, that his part, is to lye, and onely to compliment with this poore pretender, and to doe nothing at all in that, which he pretendeth. I apply my ſelfe, to that olde and ancient language of the Noblemen of <hi>Caſtile,</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grauen on the ſword, of <hi>Cid Rui DiaZ. Si, fi,</hi> no, no, yea yea nay, nay, which is a Leſſon, that is taught vs by our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour <hi>Chriſt</hi> in his holy Goſpell. This is that, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitteth all men, but more eſpecially Kings; for, to indeare this or that mans truth, we vſually ſay, <hi>Que tiene palabra de Rey:</hi> That a King cannot keepe his word, better then hee doth, or is more preciſe of his promiſe. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I hold for certaine, that that which <hi>Plato</hi> yeelds vnto Kings and Magiſtrates concerning this point, if it bee well vnderſtood, is not to lye, but to vſe ſtratagemes and poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticke deuiſes, for to defeate and deceiue the enemies ſpyes, and Intelligencers. And I very well remember that my ſelfe communicating this conceit, vpon occaſion, with one of the learnedſt men, and greateſt <hi>Platoniſts,</hi> that this Age affor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, he approued of it, and did much commend it; for, as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning that truth and faith, whereof we now treate, <hi>Plato</hi> himſelfe, and all other the good Philoſophers, teach the
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:180809:167"/>
rigour and ſtrictneſſe, wherewith men ought to keepe their word. In the booke of <hi>Ioſua,</hi> is recounted the craft, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with the <hi>Ghibeonites,</hi> mooued the Princes of <hi>Iſrael</hi> to plight them their faith, that they would doe them no harme. And though afterwards this their cunning dealing was diſcoue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red and brought to light, and that all the people were wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, that this promiſe ſhould not be kept; yet the Princes of the people made anſwer thereunto, that they could not but cumply with their word, eſpecially hauing confirmed it with an oath. <hi>Iurauimus eis in nomine Domini Dei Iſrael,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Ioſh. 9.15.</note> 
                     <hi>&amp; idcircò non poſſumus eos contingere.</hi> We haue ſworne vnto them by the Lord God of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and therefore wee may not hurt them. And becauſe many yeares after, King <hi>Saul</hi> (out of a zeale to the good of his people) broake that their word and promiſe, there fell vpon him and his people a great famine, which continued for the ſpace of three yeares. King <hi>Don Sancho,</hi> whom they ſlew by treaſon, confeſſed; that that death, lighted worthily vpon him, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe hee had broaken his word, giuen to his father King <hi>Don Fernando,</hi> to paſſe the partition made with his bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren; And the conſtancie of <hi>Dauid</hi> is knowen to all, in keeping that his word, which all the while he liued hee gaue to <hi>Shimei,</hi> that hee would not put him to death, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the deſert of his irreuerent language, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſpect to his perſon. And both diuine, and humane Letters are full of the ſeuere chaſticements, which God hath inflicted vpon thoſe, who haue not beene faithfull in the keeping of their faith and word. For, being that he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe is moſt faithfull, and doth boaſt himſelfe to bee ſo, he will likewiſe that men ſhould be ſo one towards another. S. <hi>Iſidore,</hi> with a great number of words, affirmeth;<note place="margin">Iſidor. lib. <hi>2.</hi> Synonimorum. D. Th. <hi>2.2.</hi> q. <hi>100.</hi> art. <hi>4.</hi> ad <hi>5.</hi>
                     </note> That we ought not to deceiue any man: and that all infidelitie, is ſinne; That no man ought to faile in that which he hath promiſed; That it is requiſite in all men, that their workes concurre with their words, without admitting any excepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:180809:168"/>
more then in two Caſes; As when that which is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed, cannot be performed without ſinne; Or when the buſineſſes, or the perſons, admit ſome notable change. And hee citeth the example of Saint <hi>Paul;</hi> Who promiſed to go to <hi>Corinth,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">2 Cor. 1.19.</note> but could not be as good as his word, for thoſe lawfull impediments, which hindred this his intended Iour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney. Whence, it followeth; That things continuing in the ſame Eſtate, a man may not, for the conueniences of his priuate profit, be wanting to his promiſe: And to maintaine the contrarie, is to lay trapps againſt the truth of faith, and to arme policie againſt the religion of an oath. In a word, all doe reſolue, that all promiſes are to be kept, and that no deceite or faithleſſe dealing ought to be tolerated. And the reaſon, whereupon they ground it, is common; for that <hi>fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delitas eſt fundamentum Iuſtitiae;</hi> Faithfullneſſe is the founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Iuſtice, and all Contractation; And that this being taken away, all commerce amongſt men, muſt expire with it, without the which the world cannot be conſerued. For they, not reſting aſſured, that that which is promiſed, ſhall be performed, they will not truſt one another. <hi>Marcus Tullius,</hi> ſayth very well, that this humane faith is ſo neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary amongſt men, that, euen Thieues and Pyrates could not liue, if they were not true amongſt themſelues, and kept their word one with another. And though all, euen the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt, ought to keepe their word, yet much more carefully ought Kings; and Princes; for there is nothing more vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy them, then to fayle in their faith, and word, which aboue all earthly things they ought to keepe, and cumply with all, becauſe they are as Gods vpon earth, and the Head of their people. Wherefore, their ſingle word ought to be as an Oracle, and to be more firme, ſure, and of greater credit, then any bond or obligation whatſoeuer that is ſealed and ſigned with an oath. Let the Politicians ſay what they pleaſe, and that it is good and ſound aduiſe, that a Prince, for to conſerue his State, may do an act contrary to Faith &amp;
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:180809:168"/>
Religion, and neither keepe his word, nor oath; yet muſt I be bold to tell them, that this is wicked, vngodly, and beaſtly Counſaile, and contrary to the whole Schoole of learned Doctors, and holy fathers; who affirme: that a Prince is bound to keepe his word, though hee take not an oath for the performance thereof, but much more if he ſhall ſweare, and binde it by an oath. And if they will not yeeld to this, let theſe Politicians plucke off their maske, and let thoſe that be their ſectuaries, ſpeake plaine language, and tell mee what they thinke of thoſe Princes, (as of <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſmund,</hi> and others) who made no reckoning of that they promiſe and ſweare, when as by the breach thereof, they haue beene vtterly ouerthrowne, when they moſt aſſured themſelues of Victorie. I doubt not but they will hold it for a fooliſh reaſon of State. For by this falſifying, Princes ſhall preſently looſe all their cerdit and reputation, and all their cunning ſhall not profit them, for they will neuer afterwards be beleeued. As it is in one of the lawes of the <hi>Partida.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">

                     <hi>No le creerian los homes, que le oyeſſen maguer que dixeſſen ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dad.</hi> Men will not beleeue, what they heare from them, though they ſpeake truth. <hi>Titus Liuius,</hi> holdes it a bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barous Act, That Princes ſhould tye their faithfullneſſe to Fortune, to runne along with the times, and to ſhift ſayles with euery winde. For by this meanes the word of a Prince will come to be like vnto the <hi>Lesbian</hi> rule,<note place="margin">Auguſt. in Apolog.</note> which chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth and altereth it ſelfe, according to the building, and is crooked, and ſtreight, ſhort, or long, ſutable to the bigneſſe or proportion of the ſtone, or timber which the carpenter, or maſon, heweth, or cutteth.</p>
                  <p>But let vs conclude this ſecond point, with this; That realitie, and ſinceritie both in words and deedes, is very ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary for all ſortes of perſons, but more particularly, for Kings and Princes, who ſhould rather ſee Heauen and earth to fayle, then that they ſhould faile in their promiſes. Let them firſt well weigh and conſider with themſelues, what
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:180809:169"/>
they either ſay, or promiſe, that it be agreeable to the Law of God, and to the precepts of the Church, but af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards, let them infallibly obſerue and keepe the ſame. For in this, conſiſteth the conſeruation, and augmentati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of great States; And is that true reaſon of State, which makes Kings more powerfull, more rich, more eſteemed, and more obeyed. For hee that keepes his faith, and his word, holdes the hearts of men in his hand, is Maſter of all their wealth, and all becauſe they reſt aſſured, that they may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidently relye vpon his faith and word. Wheras, by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, hath inſued the deſtruction of Common-wealths, the diſtruſtfullneſſe of their ſubiects, the ſcorne and contempt of their enemies, and the iealouſie of their friends and confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derates, who all hang and depend vpon the truth of his words, and the performance of his Contracts. And this being once loſt, with it hee looſeth his credit, and after that all goes to wracke with it. For <hi>Malignitas</hi> (ſaith the Wiſe man) <hi>euertet ſedes potentium: Malignitie</hi> or ill-min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dedneſſe,<note place="margin">Wiſd. 5.14.</note> (which is nothing elſe, but a Lye or deceit) ſhall ouerthrowe the ſeates of the Mighty. And <hi>Cicero</hi> ſaith; That it is a moſt wicked and abhominable thing, to breake that word, which conſerueth a ſociable life betwixt man and man. For (as <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> affirmeth) Pacts and Couenants, being broaken &amp; violated, there is taken away from amongſt men, the vſe, trading, and commerce of things. Theſe, and the like effects, cauſe in a King, either the keeping, or looſing of his Credit. But of no leſſe importance is that third point, which followeth in the next place, concerning ſecrecie.</p>

The Ancient, eſteem'd him a God vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on earth, that was a friend to ſilence, repreſenting him in a creature of that Region, which hath no tongue. Imply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thereby, that that man is the liuely image and true picture of God, whoſe diſcretion teacheth him, how, when, and where, to holde his peace: Alluding happily vnto that of <hi>Dauid,</hi> who finding eyes, eares, and hands in God,<note place="margin">Pſal. 62.11.</note> ſeemeth not to finde that hee had a tongue. For, as hee is God, he neuer ſpake but once. <hi>Semel locutus eſt Deus:</hi> God hath ſpoaken once. And the Spouſe ſpeaketh much of all the parts of her beloued, but of his Tongue, as if hee had no ſuch thing. And he, that ſhall not ſpeake a word out of ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, nor ſay any more then what is fitting, it may bee ſayd of that man, that hee hath no Tongue. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore did that holy King <hi>Dauid</hi> ſo often beg of God, that hee would open his mouth with his owne hand, and ſo order his Tongue that he might not ſpeake, but when he
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:180809:170"/>
would haue him, and that he would teach him what, and how to ſpeake. <hi>Illius labia aperit</hi> (ſaith S. <hi>Auſten) qui non ſolum, quod loquitur, ſed etiam quandò, &amp; vbi, &amp; cui loquatur, attendit:</hi> God opens that mans lips, who at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendeth not onely what he ſpeaketh, but alſo when, where, and to whom he ſpeaketh. <hi>Merito igitur ſapiens eſt</hi> (addeth the ſame holy father) <hi>qui accipit a Domino, quo tempore loquendum ſit:</hi> Deſeruedly therefore is he to be held a wiſe man, which receiueth inſtruction from the Lord, when he ought to ſpeake. And the Scripture ſaith; <hi>Vir ſapiens tacebit vſque ad tempus:</hi> A wiſe man will holde his peace till hee ſee his time. Nay <hi>Chriſt</hi> himſelfe, that King of Kings ſaith of himſelfe by the Prophet <hi>Eſay;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Iſay. 50.4.</note> that his eternall Father gaue him an exceeding wiſe and prudent tongue. <hi>Dedit mihi Dominus linguam eruditam:</hi> The Lord God, hath giuen me a learned tongue; Or, as the Hebrew renders it, <hi>Eruditiorum;</hi> The tongue of the learned; Not an ordinary tongue, but ſuch a Tongue, wherin was to be found the wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, and prudence of all the wiſe men of the world, and from whence all might learne. <hi>Vt ſciam ſuſtentare eum, qui lapſus eſt verbo:</hi> That I may know how to vphold him, that hath ſlipt in his word; Or (as the 70. tranſlate it) <hi>Vt ſciam quando oporteat loqui verbum:</hi> That I ſhould know how to ſpeake a word in ſeaſon to him that is weary. So that a wiſe, diſcreete, and prudent Tongue, and ſuch a one as is giuen by God, is that, which knowes when to ſpeake, and when to hold it's peace. Teaching Kings, who are in a manner Gods, at leaſt Gods Liuetenants, ſhould in this particular imitate him. That they ſhould haue a wiſe Tongue, to know when to open the doore of the lips, and when to ſhut them, what to vtter, and what to conceale. For, this is the Learning and wiſedome of the Tongue, either to ſpeake, or be ſilent, as ſhall fute beſt with time, and occaſion. <hi>Tempus tacendi, &amp; tempus loquendi:</hi> It is <hi>Salomons;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Eccl. 3.7.</note> A time to keepe ſilence, and a time to ſpeake.
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:180809:170"/>
And in Kings, this is ſo much the more important, by how much the more graue and weighty are thoſe buſineſſes, which are treated with them. For, it doth not onely be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit them, in not hauing their purpoſes preuented, not their deſignes ouerthrowne, but likewiſe winn's them much authoritie and credit. For the world will ſtand as it were a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoniſhed and amazed, and men will wonder at that, which they both doe, and ſay, and out of euery kinde of geſture, or word of theirs, will make a Myſtery, deliuer their iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and draw thence a thouſand diſcourſes, all which are but cranes and pullyes to make them mount higher in opinion, and reputation. Likewiſe, when Miniſters ſhall take notice, that their King knowes how to heare, and how to hold his peace, and in it's due time, to execute his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions, they liue in a great deale the more awe and feare, leſt ſuch and ſuch things (wherein they doe amiſſe) might come to his knowledge: And when they ſee, that he knowes how to conceale a ſecret, till it's fit time and ſeaſon, it keepes them within their Compaſſe, and is the only bridle, that reſtraines them from doing ill, either by way of oppreſſion (whereunto great Miniſters are too much ſubiect) or other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe. And therefore, it ſhall much concerne a King, not onely to be ſecret in thoſe things, which might cauſe ſome inconuenience, if he ſhould ſpeake of them, and make them knowen, but alſo in thoſe things, which bring no profit by their publication. For, if they ſhall once perceiue, that their King cannot conceale, what is deliuered vnto him vnder the ſeale of ſilence, in preiudice of this, or that par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular party, no man will date to informe, and aduiſe him of that, which may redound to Gods ſeruice, and the good of the Common-wealth. And ſo like bad gameſters, they will for want of keeping cloſe their cardes, let their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary winne the game, by diſcouering their hand. A Kings heart, ſhould be ſo deepe and profound, that none ſhould be able to pry into it, not to know what is hidden there.

And therefore he muſt haue ſuch a ſecret heart, as S. <hi>Auſten</hi> ſpeakes of;<note place="margin">Auguſt. Pſal. <hi>63.</hi> ver. <hi>7.</hi>

And ſome compare a kings heart vnto <hi>punctum,</hi> a little point or pricke, which to diuide, or to draw any thing out of it, is (if not impoſſible at leaſt very difficult.

                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended vnto him. <hi>Salomon</hi> ſayth; That the hearts of Kings, are in the hands of God; and are guided &amp; directed by him. And that therfore their ſecretes &amp; myſteries, are not to be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vulged, and made common, no not to his neereſt Minions and Fauourites; &amp; when at moſt, but to ſome one particular <hi>priua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do,</hi> and that vpon very good &amp; iuſt cauſe. Our Sauiour <hi>Chriſt,</hi> once, (vpon neceſſary occaſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>) diſcouered a ſecret to his great <hi>Priuado,</hi> or fauourite, S. <hi>Iohn,</hi> but it was with theſe circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances; That hee told it him in his eare, forbidding him to ſpeake therof vnto any. And becauſe, neither by ſignes, or any other outward demonſtration, he might make it knowen, he bound vp all his ſenſes in a deepe and profound ſleepe, to the end, that by none of them, he might expreſſe that, which it behooued him to conceale. Great is the importancie of ſecre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie, &amp; the authoritie which it giues to the iudgements, &amp; mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiues of thoſe that gouerne. For, if all might know the cauſes, which moue a Prince to make this or that prouiſion, to giue, this this or iudgement, to pardon, or to puniſh, to craue, or to giue, many cenſures wold paſſe vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> it, &amp; it might cauſe many ſcandalls &amp; alterations in a Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon wealth. And therfore it much concerneth ſo ſupreme a Maieſty not to ſuffer the ſecret which is ſhut vp in his boſome, to be publiſhed to the world. And in ſome caſes, it may come to be a mortal ſin, when ſuch things as are aduertiſed a king, &amp; ſuch Memorials as are giuen him firmed &amp; ſigned with this or that mans hand, he ſhal ſhew them to the parties, whom they touch and concerne, be they Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters,
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:180809:171"/>
or fauourites, in regard of the great hurt, oppoſition, and diſſention, which there-fro may ariſe. But hee may doe this, in caſe it may well ſort with the ſecret it ſelfe, to take out the pithe and ſubſtance of it, and without ſhewing any firme, or vttring any word whereby the Author may be knowen, and ſhew it to the Delinquent (if ſo he thinke fit) for his correction, and amendment. And when hee findes that to be true which hath beene told him, and that it cannot be denyed, let him apply a due and fitting reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy. For many times Diſſimulation in the Prince (not ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming to take notice of a fault) cauſeth but the more diſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luteneſſe in the ſubiect.</p>
                  <p>This is ſo farre forth, as concerneth Kings,<note place="margin">Caelius. Lib. <hi>13.</hi> Lectio antiq. c. <hi>5.</hi>

                  <p>But let vs now begin to ſpeake of Miniſters, and Secre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taries of State, in whom vſually lyes the greater fault. And to whom, by their Office, ſecrecie more properly belongs. The name it ſelfe expreſing as much. For, out of that obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation which they haue to be ſecret, they are called Secre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taries, and are the Archiues and Cabinets of the ſecrets of the King, and the kingdom. Though this name through the ſoothing and flattery of your ſuitors,<note place="margin">He means the <hi>Eſcrinanos,</hi> and Notaries of <hi>Spaine,</hi>
                     </note> hath falſely exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded it ſelfe to thoſe, which neither keepe ſecret, nor treate of ſuch buſineſſes as require ſecrecie. And it is fit, that theſe names ſhould not be thus confounded, or that that Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor and Title ſhould be giuen to him, to whom by Office it not appertaineth. Secretaryes I ſay, ſhut vp with that ſecrecie,<note place="margin">Apoc. 5.1.</note> as was that booke of thoſe ſecret Myſteries which Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> found ſealed with ſeuen ſeales, which none,<note place="margin">Tobit. 12.7.</note> but the King himſelfe could open. <hi>Sacramentum Regis bonum eſt</hi> (ſayd the Angel <hi>Raphael</hi> to <hi>Toby) opera autem Dei reuelare, honorificum eſt:</hi> It is good to keepe cloſe the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:180809:172"/>
of a King, but it is honourable to reueale the worke of God. Which is as much to ſay, as that the determina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of a King ſhould be kept ſecret, but that the effects and execution of them ſhould be publiſhed and made ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt, when it is fitting for the ſeruice of God, and the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome. For a Kings ſecret, is his heart, and till that God ſhall moue him to expreſſe it by ſome outward worke, there is no reaſon that any one elſe ſhould diſcouer it. To reueale a ſecret, is by the Lawes of God, and Nature, and by all men generally condemned, and all Lawes, and Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, doe ſeuerely puniſh the ſame, for the great hurt, and many inconueniences, that may follow thereupon. The Lawes, they are defrauded, the reſolutions of Kings, they are hindred; their enemies, they are aduertiſed; their friends they are offended; mens mindes, they are perturbed; king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes, they are altered; peace; that is loſt; the delinquents, they are not puniſhed; And laſtly all publicke and priuate buſineſſes are ouerthrowen. And there is not any thing, that goes croſſe, or amiſſe in a State, or that miſcarryes or is loſt, but by the reuealing of the ſecrets of Kings, and of their Counſells. As that great Chancellour <hi>Gerſon</hi> told the King of <hi>France,</hi> touching the ill ſucceſſe of ſome things in his time, for that ſome of his Miniſters did publiſh that which was treated and determined at the Counſell-Table. And the like befell <hi>Enrique,</hi> King of <hi>Portugall;</hi> Who, becauſe hee was deafe, they were faigne to ſpeake ſo loud vnto him,<note place="margin">Valer. lib. <hi>2.</hi> Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rabi.

And they, and the <hi>Perſians,</hi> did keepe with that faith the ſecrets of their Kings, that there was no feare of plumping them, or being able to draw any thing from them, no not ſo much as the leaſt word, whereby to diſcouer the buſineſſe.

feare of puniſhment, and hazard of their liues, had ſo ſettled and confirmed this ſilence in them.

As alſo, for that it being communicated to others, though it come to be diſcouered by anothers fault, and none of his, yet the imputation is laid as well vpon him, that was ſilent, as on him that reuealed; and ſo muſt ſuffer for another mans errour. And in caſe any

man ſhall incurre any iuſt ſuſpition thereof, let the King withdraw his fauour from him, diſmiſſe him the Court, and put another in his place, that ſhall be more ſecret; for that which they moſt pretend, is their fidelitie in this point. And howbeit, they haue neuer ſo many other vertues, and good abilities, yet wanting this, they want all; and are of no vſe, no more then were thoſe veſſells in Gods Houſe, which had no Couers to their mouthes.

And therfore your Naturalliſts ſay; that Nature placed two vaines in the Tongue; the one going to the heart, the other to the braine. To the end that that which remaines ſecret in the heart, the Tongue ſhould not vtter, ſaue what reaſon and the vnderſtanding haue firſt regiſtred, conformable to that Order, which is betweene the faculties of the Soule, and of the Body, it being fit that the Imagination ſhould firſt conceiue, and the Tongue afterwards bring forth: that thinke, the other ſpeake.

                  <p>It is worthy our weighing, how much importeth the warineſſe in our words, for Gods honour, and the Kings credit and authoritie, which is much abuſed and leſſened by futile, and flippant tongues, to the great hurt of a king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, and the good gouernment of the Common-wealth.

<pb n="326" facs="tcp:180809:174"/>
of ſecrets, either out of their reſpect to ſuch and ſuch perſons, or for their particular Intereſts, or out of the weakeneſſe of a ſlippery tongue. Let Priuie-Counſellours (I ſay) and Secretaries of State, bridle their tongues; If not, let Kings, if they can, reſtraine them. And if they cannot do it of themſelues, let them petition God, as <hi>Dauid</hi> did; <hi>In camo et fraeno maxillas eorum conſtringe:</hi>

Which is ſo much the greater, by how much the more diſſembled and feigned it is. The ſacred Scripture tearmes it abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely a ſinne, and ſays, that a flatterer, is abſolutely a ſinner. So ſome doe paraphraſe vpon that Verſe; <hi>Oleum autem peccatoris:</hi> The oyle, or balme of a ſinner. For in it is included all ſortes of ſinne whatſoeuer, and aboue all a great neglect and contempt of God: for although this be to be ſeene in all kinde of ſinnes, yet doth it more particularly expreſſe it ſelfe in thoſe, which draw not with them any delight, which they doe as it were vnprofitably, and <hi>ſine pretio;</hi> for it brings them no profit at all, vnleſſe (when moſt) a little Vanitie, which they more eſteeme, then God. Theſe, that they may gaine the kings elbowe, or that they may not bee put from it, ſpeake al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes vnto him in fauour of that, which hee deſireth; and all their Artifice and cunning is, to conceale the Truth, and that the doore may be ſhut againſt him, that may tell it him, or thoſe that know not (like themſelues) how to pleaſe the Kings palate. And being confident, that they will giue eare to euery word which they ſpeake, they lay falſehoods and lyes athwart their way, fathering ſuch Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Proweſſe and valour vpon Kings, that they haue much adoe to for-beare laughing, that heare their folly. For there are ſome prayſes, that are diſ-prayſes, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dound much to the diſgrace and diſhonour of Princes.
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:180809:175"/>
For by thoſe vntruths, wherewith they ſooth and flatter them, they breed ſuſpition of that good which is in them. And becauſe they make pleaſing the marke whereat they ſhoote, they neuer looke, whether it be a lye, or a truth, which they deliuer, nor haue an eye more vnto good, then ill; iuſte or vniuſt, againſt God, or his neighbour, all is one: Cannonizing their King for a Saint, though they know the contrary. Theſe (ſaith <hi>Nazianzene</hi>) are like to your Sorcerers of <hi>Egypt,</hi> which were about <hi>Pharaohs</hi> perſon, who with feigned Prodigies, did pretend to eaſe his heart of that griefe which thoſe plagues did cauſe in him. Ambitious and proud men are theſe, which thus re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt the truth, and that they may not fall from their bias, oppoſe themſelues to thoſe that ſpeake the truth, and minde nothing elſe, but to caſt a fayre colour on thoſe things, whereunto they ſee their Prince ſtands affected. They come of the race of your Cameleons, which liue by the ayre, and cloath themſelues with the colour of that whereunto they approach neereſt. If they ſee the King troubled, they are troubled; if merry, they are merry; if ſad, they are ſad; Hauing their teares as neere at hand, as their ſmiles, for to deceiue him; And the better to content him, they change themſelues into a thouſand colours: in all they imitate him: in all doe they labour to repreſent him to the true life. There is not that glaſſe, which ſo liuely repreſents the face, the ſemblance, and actions of thoſe that looke therein, as the flatterer (who is that ſhadow which alwayes followes the body of him hee flattereth) doth his Kings countenance, his motions, his poſtures, his geſtures, his ſaying, and his doings. For, as they ſee him either ſay, or doe, ſo doe they. Being like vnto the Echo, which anſwereth to the laſt ſyllable of euery word that is voyced in the Ayre. Theſe are the Kings Echos, which anſwer him in all, not onely in that which the voyce ſoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth; but in that which they imagine to be to his liking:
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:180809:175"/>
Being herein very like vnto thoſe lying Hypocrites which thinke one thing, and make ſhew of another. But they are preſently diſcouered, and this their ſecond intention ſoone vnderſtood, which is, To lye, and flatter, to make themſelues gratious, and to bring their buſineſſes the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter about, though it be to the hurt of others. With one ſingle truth, they will dawbe ouer a thouſand lyes; As per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fumers doe a great deale of Leather, with a little Ciuit. And thus ſoothing and ſuppling the eares of Princes with a ſubtill ſofteneſſe, and deceitfull ſweetneſſe, thy powre lyes into them, and working them with a gentle hand, they paſſe for truths, Whilſt theſe falſe perſwaders falſifie the Truth, and are worſe members in a Common-wealth then thoſe that falſifie the Kings Coine; and ſinne more grieuouſly then thoſe that beare falſe witneſſe. For theſe, by their teſtification, deceiue onely the Iudge, that is to ſentence the cauſe; but theſe with their faire and falſe flatteries, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly cozen and deceiue Kings, but corrupt and infect them, &amp; make them to perſeuere in their errours. <hi>Per dulces ſermones, &amp; benedictiones,</hi>

And therefore with the greater and more grieuous puniſhments ought they to be puniſhed. They are not ſo ſquezy ſtomackt, as to make dainty of Lying, nor make they any bones to tell an vntruth, if thereby they thinke they may pleaſe. And as ſoone will they lay hold on a Lye, as a truth, ſo as they reſt well apayd there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with to whom they vent their flatterie and their Leaſings. And ſome are ſo trayned and bred vp to them that they take delight to heare them, and doe as verily beleeue them, as they doe their Creede. And ſo cloſe doth this falſehood cleaue vnto them, that without any occaſion or cauſe giuen they leane thereunto, and ſtedfaſtly beleeue, that they haue that goodneſſe in them, which they want, and not that bad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, wherein they exceede. For, being ſenceleſſe of their
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:180809:176"/>
owne defects, they no ſooner heare themſelues commended but they are preſently puffed vp, and conceit themſelues to ſurpaſſe all other Princes.

And let not kings thinke, becauſe they are kings, that they are free from this Tyrant, but in that they are kings, are ſo daintilie bread, ſo deliciouſly ſed, and make ſo much of themſelues, they are more ſubiect thereunto, for that their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall condition, conformes it ſelfe more to it's guſte, &amp; plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, and is a great friend of <hi>Regalas</hi> of daintineſſe, and nice vſage, of fine linnen, ſoft raiment, choice deliacies, and all that which cauſeth delight, &amp; prouoketh pleaſure. And in Courts, and Kings Pallaces, and in the houſes of Princes and great Perſons,<note place="margin">Luk. 7.25.</note> theſe things are in greateſt requeſt. <hi>Ecce, qui in veſte pretioſa ſunt &amp; delicijs, in domibus Regum ſunt.</hi> Behold, they which are gorgeouſly apparelled, and liue delicately, are in Kings Courts.

Yet for all this doe not I ſay, That Princes, and great Lords, liuing in this State and Pompe, cannot <hi>eo nomine</hi> bee ſaued, but to ſhew that in all Eſtates there is a great deale of danger; but much more in your daintier, and nicer ſort of people: Nor will I with all my force ſtraine this vnto Kings, as well witting, what their Eſtate and Greatneſſe, doth admit and require. And that as Nature did difference them from the reſt both in blood, and birth, ſo likewiſe ought there to be a diſtinction in their diet, raiment, and in the fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhing and adorning of their houſes. But I ſay that which cannot be denied, that in excuſe of this their ſtate and
<pb n="345" facs="tcp:180809:183"/>
conueniencie, they take vnto themſelues heerein too large a li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence, and paſſe to ſoone from the foote, to the hand; &amp; from the hand, to the mouth; making of an inch an ell, and of an, elll an Aker. So hard a matter is in for great Princes to mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate themſelues, and vſe a meane. And that Heathen was not much wide of the marke, who ſayd in the Senate, That that is an vnfortunate Eſtate, that obligeth a man to liue alwayes vp to the eyes grazing in his pleaſures and delightes: And that it is a very bad <hi>O men,</hi> for a man, to liue all his life time, according to the ſauour and guſte of his palate. <hi>Conſuetudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nem nullam peiorem eſſe, quàm vt ſemper vinat quis ad vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luptatem:</hi> There is not any cuſtome ſo bad, as that of a mans liuing according to his owne pleaſure.

Onely for to pleaſe and ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie this ſenſe, and to recreate that of the ſight, haue ſo many Artes beene inuented, ſo many ſorts of Trades, and Trades-men ſet a worke, ſo much varietie of faſhions and coſtly cloathes, ſuch a world of curious Silkes, Lawnes, Cambricks, and Hollands, ſuch large beds, rich bedding, ſumptuous bed-ſteds, ſo ſenſuall, and ſo ouer nice and dainty, that it may well be queſtioned whether is greater, the coſtlineſſe or the curioſitie; the richneſſe, or the ryot occaſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by them? Nor (which is the miſerie of it) is it yet known, whether or how farre this Humour will extend it ſelfe. But ſure I am, that thereby houſes are diſordred, much monyes conſumed, ancient Inheritances ſolde away, and a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand other inconueniences introduced. And (to ſay the truth) this ſenſe hath not neede of ſo much nicetie, but abuſe hath now brought it to that paſſe, that it hath no ſooner a liking to a thing, but it greedily runn's after it, as a beaſt that is put into a freſh ground, runnes vp and downe, ſmelling out the choice graſſe, and will not bite but at the ſweeteſt. But he that doth <hi>Regalor,</hi> and pamper

But it is not my Intent, to ſet my cloath on the Tenters, nor in this little Loome to weaue large Hiſtories, and long diſcourſes, but onely to giue a ſhort touch, and away, of the effects, which this ſence cauſeth, and of the miſeries and misfortunes, which are incident to Touching, and that all the worke, &amp; paines which it does and takes for it's friends, and beſt well-wiſhers, is not ſo freely beſtow'd, nor that good aſſurance giuen thereof, but that this it's momentary pleaſure, makes quick payment, in groanes, in diſeaſes, and in Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall, and Eternall Death; The condition of the obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion being drawen and ſigned by no worſe a Scriuener then Saint <hi>Paul;</hi>

There are two remedies found, for the curing of ſo many dammages and diſorders, as we perceiue to be in this ſenſe of Touching, and that of the Taſt.

As with it, ſo is it with man. <hi>Homo ſicut faenum:</hi> Man is but as graſſe, or as the flower of the field; Which is no ſooner vp, but is cut downe; no ſooner flouriſheth, but it fadeth; and all it's beautie no ſooner appeareth, but it pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſheth, and withereth away, and is no more to be ſeene. And the more wee make of much our ſelues, the leſſe while we liue. We are alwayes crazy; ſoone downe, but not ſo ſoone vp; Quickly fall into a diſeaſe, but long ere we can get out of it; Looſing our ſtrength, before we come to it, and waxing olde, before euer wee be aware of it. But if a man will lay aſide this Cockering and pampering vp of himſelfe, and habituate himſelfe to labour and trauaile, he ſhall paſſe his life the better. For health neuer dwells with delights; nor ſtrength, ioyne hands with choice fare. Nor ſhall hee euer doe any famous Acts, and worthy renowne, that feares to take paines, and is willing to take his eaſe. The Emperour <hi>Hadrian,</hi> was ſingular herein. <hi>Frigora enim, &amp; tempeſtates, ita patienter tulit, vt nunquam caput tegeret:</hi> Hee did indure colds, and all kinde of fowle weather with that patience, that hee neuer put on his hatt, but alwayes went bare-headed.

fellowes, to apply themſelues to the pleaſures and contentments of this life; but for Noble hearts, and gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous ſpirits, to accuſtome themſelues to labour, and to take paines. In a word, Temperance is a vertue very neceſſarie for all eſtates; it will ſute well with all: but more particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly with Kings, and Princes, and great perſons; becauſe it is in it ſelfe a vertue ſo gentleman-like, ſo worthy Noble perſons, and ſo proper for royall Maieſtie. As likewiſe, for that they liue, as they doe, amidſt ſo many regalos, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights, ſo many curious meates, and a thouſand other occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, whereby, if they doe not arme themſelues with this vertue, not onely their liues, but their ſoules, are like to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curre the great danger. For like theeues in a mans owne houſe, or cloſe traitours lurking in ſecret corners, ſome while one, ſome while another, are neuer from their elbow, till they deliuer them ouer into the hands of death; or at leaſt hoxe their courage, and cut off their health. Which in good Kings ſo much importeth, and which all men deſire may be long and proſperous. The want whereof in a parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular perſon importeth little; but in them it mattereth much, in regard of the great loſſe which the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth thereby receiueth. For on their welfare, dependeth the generall comfort and gouernment of the whole king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, which when it is wanting in them, that want is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon to all.</p>
                  <p>Let then the concluſion of this diſcourſe be, That Kings ought to keepe an orderly and temperate diet, hauing more regard to the law of Nature, and vnto Chriſtian reaſon, then to their greatnes of ſtate, and Maieſtie of Empire; And to carry themſelues amidſt ſo many occaſions of pleaſures and delights with that modeſtie and moderation, as if they were without them, if they haue a minde to preſerue their bodies and their ſoules healths; and to giue vnto all a good example; which is another (as already hath beene ſaid) ſo powerfull a remedy for to perſwade other Princes and Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentates
<pb n="354" facs="tcp:180809:188"/>
of his kingdome, to the embracing of this vertue. And beſides that obſeruation of <hi>Hipocrates, Quod plures cecîdit gula, quam gladius:</hi> That ſurfeiting hath killed more then the ſword. Let thoſe that place all their care in theſe their delights and pleaſures, conſider that ſaying of <hi>Cato,</hi> That our much carefulneſſe in this, cauſeth much for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getfulneſſe of God. And there are ſome that count it an honour and reputation vnto them to eate and to drinke, (though <hi>Sanitas eſt animae &amp; corporis ſobrius potus</hi>) and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they are great in eſtate, they will alſo be great feeders. Which indeed is not Greatneſſe, nor Lordlineſſe, but great baſeneſſe, and vnbeſeeming their authoritie, to ſuffer them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues to be giuen to gluttony, and to the exceſſe of eating and drinking. Saint <hi>Bernard</hi> did bleſſe himſelfe, and much wonder, at ſo much time and wealth as herein was ſpent; and at ſo many Cookes, and other Officers, herein em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed.

                     <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg> King being (as hath beene ſaid) the ſoule and heart of a kingdome, and like another Sunne, which with its light and motion, affoords light and health to the world; being the true picture and liuely Image of God vpon earth; and he that is moſt (being iuſt) like vnto him, hath a great and preciſe obligation lying vpon him, both by his life and example, to giue life vnto his kingdome, and to ſet himſelfe, as a patterne, before his ſubiects, that, and they, being that myſticall bodie, whereof he is the head. And ſee what dependencie the members in mans bodie haue on the head; the ſame, or little leſſe, haue ſubiects on their Kings. And if that be ſound and good, it is well with all the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers; but if ill affected, all of them ſuffer with it. The Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerbe ſaith, <hi>Cum caput dolet, catera membra dolent.</hi> When the head aketh, the reſt of the members ake with it. And as it is ſo true, as nothing more, ſo is it more in Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealths, then mens bodies. For, as the humours of theſe are in or out of order, according to thoſe which the head communicateth vnto them. So likewiſe the compoſition of a whole kingdome, dependeth on the good or ill compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition of their King and Head. Whence it followeth, that the ſame neceſſitie which a body hath of a good head, the very ſelfeſame hath a kingdome of a good King; being that he as hee is King (as already hath beene deliuered) doth therein ſupply the Office of the Head. And therefore it was well ſaid of <hi>Plato,</hi> That the inclining of a King to
<pb n="356" facs="tcp:180809:189"/>
good, or ill, is the inclining of the whole kingdome, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to his ſcale or ballance; they bend all the ſame way, &amp; follow him, as the ſhadow doth the body. <hi>Mouetur cu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipe mobile vulgus:</hi> As the Prince moues, ſo doth the wauer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing multitude. In vaine do we ſeeke to rectifie the ſhadow, if the body be crooked. The waues of the ſea, go that way as the winde driues them; and the vulgar are led along by the example of thoſe their Kings, that gouerne them. <hi>Aquae multae populi ſunt:</hi> The common people are as many wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters. The ſpirit and winde that moues them, is the King, who with great force carries the mindes of his ſubiects this way or that way, as beſt pleaſeth him. By onely ſeeing Saint <hi>Peter</hi> abſtaine from ſome meate, and eate of other ſome, without commanding it, or ſaying any thing there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of to thoſe new conuerted Chriſtians,<note place="margin">Galat. 2.14.</note> Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, that he carried them away, and drew them to doe the like. For, there is neither Law, nor Precept, nor force, can be compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red with that which the example of a King works vpon his ſubiects, forcing them to imitate and follow him. King <hi>Manaſſes</hi> (ſaith the ſacred Text) <hi>fecit malum coram Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>no:</hi> He did that which was euill in the ſight of the Lord; for he forſooke him to follow ſtrange Gods, like vnto the ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>homination of the heathen. And anon after drawes thence this conſequence or concluſion:<note place="margin">2 Chron. 33.9.</note> 
                     <hi>Igitur Manaſſes ſeduxit po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulum, vt faceret malum:</hi> So <hi>Manaſſes</hi> made <hi>Iudah,</hi> and the Inhabitants of Ieruſalem to erre, and doe worſe then the heathen, &amp;c. But tell me, I pray, how came it to paſſe, that this King ſhould caſt ſuch a miſt before his ſubiects eyes, that he ſhould thus deceiue them, and make them doe as he did? For we doe not finde there, that he ſaid any one word vnto them, or induced them thereunto by any other diligences, whereby to perſwade them to commit the like ſinne. Though he did not, yet he did enough, in doing that which he did, as being their King and Head. For, as the Soueraigne doth, ſo doth the ſubiect. King <hi>Hamor,</hi> and
<pb n="357" facs="tcp:180809:189"/>
Prince <hi>Shechem</hi> his ſonne, by their bare example onely per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded their people the Shechemites, to leaue that law, wherein they had beene bred and brought vp, and to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertaine that of the Hebrewes, though it turned to the loſſe of all their liues. Of Kings, ſaith a Romane Philoſopher, <hi>Quaecunque vitia ipſi concipiunt, ea infundunt in ciuitates;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Julius lib. <hi>3.</hi> de Legibus.</note> 
                     <hi>plus exemplo, quam peccato nocent:</hi> Whatſoeuer vices they conceiue, they infuſe the ſame into their Cities, offending more by their example then by their ſinne. By the ſinne, they doe but aggrauate and wrong their owne conſcience; but by the example, the conſciences of all the common peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, which haue no other eyes whereby they ſee, no other rule or ſquare whereby to rule and gouerne themſelues in their actions; Nor is there any other meanes, whereby vices are communicated with more facilitie, and larger licence. And therefore it concernes them very much, not to make any the leaſt breach in good manners, nor to turne (though neuer ſo little aſide) from the way of vertue. For they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not build vp ſo faſt by their good, as they pull downe by their bad example. Beſides, the vulgar iudge their vitious actions, for vertuous; their bad, for good. And if not ſo, then will they iuſtifie their owne looſeneſſe, by laying the ſame on their King: Hee doth thus and thus, And why ſhould not I? This ſame <hi>Regis ad exemplum,</hi> runnes ouer all the world; and men are willing enough to make their aduantage of it. Of <hi>Dionyſius</hi> the <hi>Siracuſan, Plutarch</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porteth, that at firſt he was very ſtudious, and much giuen to his booke, and whileſt hee ſo continued, all his ſubiects applied themſelues to the exerciſe of good letters. But growing weary of ſo good a worke, he left off his learning, and betooke himſelfe to the vice of gaming and wanton<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe; and preſently all his ſubiects, as if they had beene be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>witched, began to loath their bookes, and fall to vice. <hi>Iſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorus</hi> ſaith of the Ethiopians, that they were ſuch Apiſh counterfeits of their Kings, that they held it a kinde of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach
<pb n="358" facs="tcp:180809:190"/>
and infamie, that if their King did want a member, or were lame, all his houſhold ſeruants were likewiſe of that faſhion; and would willingly mayme and diſmember them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues that they might be like vnto their King.</p>
                  <p>I ſay therefore againe; Let Kings looke well vnto that which they affect, and whereunto they are inclined; for the ſame will his Subiects affect, and thereunto will they all be inclined. And therefore <hi>Iſocrates</hi> did counſell his King, that hee ſhould loue and eſteeme the Arts, and ſuch Offices as might be moſt profitable for the commonwealth, and ſhould abhorre the contrary; for theſe would bring him augmenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of honour, when thoſe other would bee forgotten, or but ript vp to his ſhame; that he ſhould approue good, and reproue bad cuſtomes, and euill manners, that theſe might fall, and thoſe other be in vſe. For in regard that the King is <hi>Cenſor morum,</hi> he that cenſures our manners and behauiour, and ſets downe and determineth, which we are to flie, which to follow: Looke which he approueth, and keepeth, are kept and approued by all, and euery one does his beſt to excell therein. And thoſe which he ſhall reproue and miſlike, all men will ſhunne and auoide them. And more particularly, theſe two pernicious ones, which appertaine to Taſting and Tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching, I deſire to haue them be condemned and reproued by the example of Kings; ſuch as are exceſſe in ſumptuouſneſſe of apparell, and in meates and drinkes, and the like publike and common vices. For, by theſe two abuſes, great Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchies haue beene ruined, and ouerthrowne.</p>
                  <p>Let vs fall a little vpon the firſt; wherein is ſuch exceſſe and ſuperfluitie in this age, as neuer more. Howbeit, as it was not wanting to former times, ſo was there a great deale of care taken for the reforming thereof. Your Romanes made Lawes, for to moderate the expences and exceſſes of appar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rell and diet. The imperiall Lawes of the kingdome, and thoſe of the <hi>Partida</hi> prohibite it, and many other <hi>prematicas</hi> and Statute Lawes, which haue beene made thereupon, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed
<pb n="359" facs="tcp:180809:190"/>
by Act of Parliament. And the ſacred Scripture like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe in many places doth condemne it. And therefore a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medie in this kinde (if poſſibly it can bee procured) is very needfull: For exceſſe, doth not ſerue ſo much for ſuſtenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as for pompe and oſtentation, wherewith is fomented Ambition, vaineglory, concupiſcence, and diſhoneſtie, euen to the falling into thoſe vices, that were neuer before ſeene, or vſed. Their expence, that increaſeth, and their ſubſtance decreaſeth: what wealth can a man haue, that will ſuffice for the arraying and apparrelling of women, as alſo for the clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of men, which is no leſſe vicious, and expencefull then theirs? What doth it benefit vs, that the riches of our times are greater then thoſe of our predeceſſours, if our expences be more exceſſiue? By running on in this lauiſh courſe, great and ancient houſes haue beene brought to nothing, and new ones haue ſtarted vp in their roome, borne and bred in bad Trades, and worſe manners, who alwayes haue a ſmacke with them, or ſome touch or other of their former meaner fortune. And for this cauſe onely, are there ſo many misfortunes and diſorders in the houſes of many your ordinary and common ſort of people, and euen in ſome of thoſe that are of meaner ranke. For they had rather periſh and vndoe themſelues, then to be accounted needy and poore. And without doubt, the moſt of their ſubſtance is ſpent in meate, and clothes. Which vice ſhame would moderate in them. But the feare of ſeeming to be of leſſe abilitie then their neighbours, hath quite altered the caſe, and ſerues to helpe them on to their ruine. For euery one counts it a diſgrace vnto him, that he ſhall not go as well clad as his neighbour, and eate as good meate, and drinke as good drinke as he doth, though he pay ſoundly for it, both in his honour and eſtate. And hence proceede your briberies, corruptions, ſubornations, and iniuſtice. For ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſitie, the mother of vice, and that which makes (as we ſay) the old wife trott; putts them ſo hard to their ſhifts, that for to free themſelues from want, there is not that wickedneſſe

which they will not giue way vnto; and all, becauſe they will not lacke theſe inſtruments of their guſtes, nor want the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parence of Maieſtie in their houſes.</p>
                  <p>And another no leſſe miſchiefe then the former, is the ine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qualitie in the eſtates, and qualities of the perſons; and the equalitie wherewith the ſaid accoutrements both in meate and apparrell is vſed. For (as <hi>Plato</hi> ſaith) in a well ordered commonwealth, all ought to be equall. And yet we ſee, that meane women, that haue neither meanes nor qualitie, weare Kittles, Peticoates, and Gownes of cloth of gold, and rich imbroderies, that Queenes can ſcarce weare better. And as for our ordinary ſort of men, there are very few of them, but will go in ſuch good clothes, that Kings can not bee better clad. Of the Emperour <hi>Tiberius Caeſar, Tacitus</hi> reporteth, that by a Decree of the Senate, he did prohibite men the wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of gownes of ſilke, ſaying, That they did diſgrace them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues by putting on ſuch an effeminate habite. And of the Emperour <hi>Aurelius</hi> it is noted, that hee did not onely not weare ſilke, but would not ſo much as ſuffer any to be in his wardrope, ſaying, That hee would not buy clothes at the weight of gold. And <hi>Lampridius</hi> ſaith, That the firſt Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour that euer had any Wardrobe, was that wicked and luxu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Emperour <hi>Heliogabalus. Scipio Aphricanus,</hi> and <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander Magnus,</hi> were very ſingular in this careleſſe manly weare, whereof others are ſo curiouſly carefull. And let vs ſay no more hereof, then what <hi>Iſocrates</hi> ſaid, writing to his King, Haue a care (ſaith he) of the things of particular per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, and thinke that thoſe that liue at high and exceſſiue rates, waſte and ſpend out of thy treaſure; and that thoſe that take paines to ſcrape vp a little mucke, and to get into ſome wealth by their thrift, are the onely men that fill your coffers, and increaſe your treaſure. For the Subiects purſe is as the Kings owne purſe, if he rule and gouerne well. But when men ſhall not haue meanes ſufficient for to ſupply that exceſſe in diet, and clothes, which vice and mans fooliſh pride hath in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduced,
<pb n="361" facs="tcp:180809:191"/>
how is it poſſible that they ſhould ſerue and aſſiſt their King in the neceſſary occaſions of the kingdome? it is impoſſible but that there muſt be a failing in the one, being that the ends are ſo oppoſite. How can they haue any heart or guſte for the one, hauing placed all their care and content in the other? And queſtionleſſe, if theſe ſuperfluities were ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken away, the Subiect would haue wealth enough, and then it would neuer grieue them to part with part thereof to their Kings, or to ſpend it in his ſeruice. But that which is now per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted amongſt vs, is the ſame which the Romans permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and procured in the Nations, they had ſubdued, for to conſume and eate them out, and to keepe them in the better obedience. But in their owne commonwealth they did euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more feare it, and ſeeke to excuſe it. What Prince hath there euer beene, either of thoſe that were held to be good or indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent, that did not treate of this remedie? Not any. Yet they did moſt of them erre in the manner.</p>
                  <p>Now, to remedie this exceſſe, experience hath and doth ſhew vnto vs, that it is not the penaltie, nor rigour of the Lawes and Statutes that our Anceſtours ſeemed to haue er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in, who by thoſe penalties alone, thought to amend theſe extrauagancies in their ſubiects. But the cure of this exorbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tancie is that which the Ancient did preſcribe, and we haue declared, touching the example of Kings, and of their imita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. The deſire of giuing them content, is more powerfull with them then the feare of puniſhment. This doctrine <hi>Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citus</hi> taught, rendering the reaſon of that temperance and moderation, which was in the Emperour <hi>Veſpaſian</hi> his time in clothes and diet, and in the vitious ſuperfluitie of theſe vices. And after that he hath gone varying from one reaſon to another, he ſaith, That this Prince was the principall Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of that ſparingneſſe and thriftineſſe amongſt the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manes of thoſe times in their waſtfull expences; by exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing himſelfe in that their ancient manner of lining in matter of maintenance, apparell and the like. And hence it ſucceeded,
<pb n="362" facs="tcp:180809:192"/>
that all his ſubiects did the like, conforming themſelues ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his faſhion, their reſpect to their Prince, and their deſire to imitate him, preuailing more with them, then the puniſhment or feare of the Lawes. And this is a ſure and ſound point of doctrine, and of that great conſequence, that it neuer ought to ſlip out of the memorie and good liking of Kings, and their principall Miniſters, as being the mirrour or looking glaſſe wherein the Subiects ſee and behold whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther their manners be foule or faire, become or not become them, according to the liking which they take from their ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periours.</p>
                  <p>Of <hi>Auguſtus Caeſar, Dion</hi> reporteth, That becauſe hee would not weare ſuch clothes, as were prohibited by his Lawes, there was not a man in all his Empire that did offer to put them on. <hi>Componitur Orbis</hi> (ſaith <hi>Claudian) Regis ad exemplar, nec ſic inflectere ſenſus Humanos edicta valent, quàm vita regentis.</hi> The whole world ſhapes and faſhions it ſelfe according to the patterne their King ſets before them; nor can Edicts and Decrees worke ſo much vpon mens hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours, as the life of him that ruleth. Of all the reaſons what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer that the wit of man can deuiſe, there is not any more effectuall to perſwade hard and difficult things, then the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of Kings. Let therefore a Prince lay a more hard and cruell puniſhment vpon them, then either impriſonment, ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment, or ſome ſound fine, or pecuniary mulct, as not to doe them any grace or fauour, or not to affoord a good looke on him, that ſhall not imitate and follow his faſhion. For there is no man ſuch a foole, that will looſe the fruite of his hope, for not apparelling himſelfe after this or that manner, as he ſees the Prince himſelfe is contented to go. Let Kings amend this fault in themſelues, and then his Peeres, and other their inferiours, will not be aſhamed to imitate them. I pray tell me, if men of the baſer and meaner condition ſhould one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be thoſe, that were vicious in their meate and clothes, who would imitate them therein? Aſſuredly none. All would be
<pb n="363" facs="tcp:180809:192"/>
Noblemen, or Gentlemen, or at leaſt ſeeme to be ſo in their faſhion and apparrell, howbeit they would bee leſſe curious and dainty, if they ſaw thoſe that were noble, or gentile, go onely plaine and handſome. That ancient Romane, pure, neate, cleane, and comely attire of thoſe who conquered the world, did then wholly looſe it ſelfe, when your great and Noble perſons of that commonwealth left it off. For in all things, but more eſpecially in thoſe that are vicious, men ſeeke to make a fairer ſhew then their eſtate will beare, and thereby procure to content and pleaſe their Kings vnder whom they liue; knowing that there is no interceſſion or fauour like vnto that, as the fimiliancie of manners, and the kindred which this doth cauſe. Let Kings, by their example, cut off the vſe of coſtly clothes and ſumptuous banquets, and whatſoeuer in that kinde is vicious and ſuperfluous, and they ſhall ſtraightway ſee, how a great part of the greedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of gaine, and couetouſneſſe of money will ceaſe, and many other euils and miſchiefes which proceed from thence, which would not be ſought after nor eſteemed, were it not for the execution of the appetite, and fulfilling of our pleaſures. And for this end and purpoſe, money is kept with ſuch great anxietie and trouble, but procured and ſought after with much more; becauſe it is the maſter and commander of all pleaſures and delights whatſoeuer. For which we will buy and ſell, and giue all that we haue.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond point concerning vices and ſinnes, common and publike, the hurt that comes thereby is well knowne both to God and man, and is harder to be reformed then the former. That, is moderated either with age or neceſſitie; but this, neither neceſſitie nor time can leſſen, but with it increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth, and ſhooteth forth new ſprigges and ſuckers, neuer be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſeene, nor vſed in the world, againſt which neither ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice Lawes nor Statutes. And that doctrine of <hi>Tacitus</hi> is now come to bee verified, That there is not any greater ſigne of corruption of manners, then multiplicitie of Lawes. And
<pb n="364" facs="tcp:180809:193"/>
we now liue in thoſe dangerous times, whereof Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaketh; and I know not whether I may be ſo bold as to ſay, That it is likewiſe an argument or ſigne, that the Subiect is neare it's end, or at leaſt daily growes decaying, wherein theſe ſignes and tokens are to bee ſeene; One diſorder begetting another, which is the order which Nature keepes with things that are to periſh, till at laſt all comes to ruine; and this vniuerſall fabricke ſinkes to the bottome, neuer more to be repaired. I wot well, that whileſt there be men, there muſt be vices, and ſinnes, and that few or none will ceaſe to bee that which they are, in regard of humane weakeneſſe, and mans propenſion and inclination to ſinne, and that there are not any remedies which will ſerue and turne wholly to cure and cut them off, it being a thing impoſſible, for that their beginning and cauſe doth proceed from Nature it ſelfe being corrupted. That which the worth and wiſedome of Kings, and their Miniſters, may be able to effect, is; That they may daily proue leſſe and leſſe preiudiciall to the publike: and that the diſſembling of abuſes in the beginning, before they take head, be not a cauſe of ſeeing our ſelues brought to that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate, which <hi>Saluſt</hi> writeth Rome was found in in <hi>Catilines</hi> time, there being ſo good cauſe for to feare it. As alſo that they will draw after them Gods comminations and chaſtiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. When a kingdome (ſaith hee) comes to the corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of manners, that men doe pamper and apparell them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues in curious manner, like women, and make no reckon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of their honeſtie, but deale therewith as with any other thing that is vendible, or ſet out to ſale; and that exquiſite things, for to pleaſe the palate, are diligently ſought after both by ſea and land; that they betake themſelues to their eaſe and ſleepe, before the due time of their reſt and ſleepe be come; that after their bellies be as full as euer they can hold, they neuer ceaſe crauing and cramming till it be noone; that they doe not forbeare from eating and drinking, till they be either hungry or thirſty; not that they eaſe themſelues out of
<pb n="365" facs="tcp:180809:193"/>
wearineſſe, or keepe themſelues warme againſt the extremity of the weather: but that they do all theſe things out of vici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe, and before there is neede; well may that Empire be giuen for loſt, and that it is drawing neare to its laſt gaſpe. For the people thereof, when their owne meanes ſhall faile them, for to fulfil their appetites, out of a thirſting and greedy deſire of theſe things, what miſchiefes will not they moue, or what villanies will not they attempt? For the minde that hath beene ill, and long accuſtomed to delights, can hardly be without them. And, that they may enioy them, by hooke or by crooke, by one meanes or another, though neuer ſo vniuſt and vnlawfull, they will make a ſhift to get themſelues into money, though they ſpend it afterward idly &amp; vainly in that profuſe and lauiſh manner, for which they did intend it.</p>
                  <p>Let euery good King begge of God, and let vs all ioyne in the ſame prayer, that in our times, it may not come to theſe termes, and that Kings will ſtriue and ſtudie to quench theſe ſparkes before they breake forth into a flame, and to put out the fire whileſt it is but newly kindled, leſt it take hold on the whole building, and helpe come too late. And becauſe there are ſo many ſortes of vices, that it is not poſſible to procure an vniuerſall cure for them all; that which is likelieſt to doe moſt good, will bee that ſelfe ſame medicine mentioned be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in dyet and apparrell, to wit, the good example of Kings; and in imitation of them, that of the great Lords of the land, and thoſe that are neareſt in Court about their perſons; ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning herewith the feare of their disfauour: letting them both ſee and know, that the vicious fall backward, and the ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous come forward in honour; and that onely vertue is the true meanes and ſureſt way to bring men to great place and preferrement in the commonwealth. Let Kings hate theſe idle droanes, theſe honey-ſuckers of other mens labours, that liue all vpon the waſte and ſpoile. Which kinde of people, euen in reaſon of ſtate, are not good for the quiet of a king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, in regard of the euill cogitations and dangerous deui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
<pb n="366" facs="tcp:180809:194"/>
that are bred in their mindes, and in their time breake out. I would haue this imitation to bee the remedie for this ſo great an ill; for neither penalties nor feare of puniſhment will doe any good vpon them. For hee that will not forbeare to ſinne for feare of Gods Law, will hardly refraine from mans. Let Kings therefore ſay and doe thoſe things, that they would haue their Subiects ſay and doe. And let their fauourites, and thoſe that are neareſt about them, runne the like courſe, and let it extend to the better ſort, and thoſe that are of ranke and qualitie; for by this meane it will deſcend to thoſe like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe that are of meaner condition: and then ſhall they ſee, how much more good it will worke, then either lawes or pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment. And this is the more naturall of the two; for the one is founded vpon imitation, and the other grounded vpon feare. And men doe more eaſily imitate thoſe better things which they ſee actually put in execution, then depart from thoſe worſer things, which they either heare or know to be prohibited. And when they ſhall ſee that their ſuperiours, and thoſe that are in place and authoritie, command one thing and doe another, they neither dread their threatnings, nor obey their commandements. For perceiuing that they doe but imitate their actions, they perſwade themſelues that none can, without bluſhing, puniſh the ſame ſinne in them. <hi>Saluſt</hi> did aduiſe <hi>Caeſar</hi> in the entrance to his Empire, that if he would order his commonwealth aright, he ſhould firſt of all begin with reformation in himſelfe, and his; (as <hi>Pliny</hi> ſaith) <hi>Vita Principis cenſura eſt, eaque perpetua; ad hanc di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rigimur,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Plin. Jun. lib. Epiſt. ad ſemp. Rufum.</note> 
                     <hi>ad hanc conuertimur.</hi> The life of a Prince is a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuall cenſure; and according thereunto doe we guide and gouerne our ſelues. And let it not ſeeme vnto any, that this remedie of the imitation of Kings is ſlow, and long, and will aske a great deale of time; for where there is met together, as it were in it's center, whatſoeuer may corrupt and hurt that, which is capable of being corrupted, when as neither Kings nor their Lawes are able to hinder it, in vaine is it
<pb n="367" facs="tcp:180809:194"/>
indeuoured, or to be imagined, that that may bee cured in a few yeares, which hath layen ſicke ſo many. But till ſuch time, as men grow vp like new plants, and haue accuſtomed themſelues to vertue, to the end, that through the tenderneſſe of their youth they may not grow awry; Being therein like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe holpen, by the example of their betters; for there is not any Artifice, ſo powerfull and effectuall, as that of imitation, which I now ſpeake of; for it being a cure ſo conformable vnto nature, it will worke by degrees; whereof we ſhall not know the benefit, till we haue enioyed it.</p>
                  <p>And becauſe there are both diſeaſed perſons,<note place="margin">Chryſoſt. hom. <hi>19.</hi> in Gen.</note> and diſeaſes (as Saint <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> hath obſerued) which are neither re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medied by ſweet potions, nor purged away by bitter pills; A maine reaſon whereof is, becauſe they themſelues are not willing to be cured, nor will admit of the example of Kings, nor the feare of their Lawes: it is fit this other remedie ſhould be vſed, of puniſhment and chaſtiſement, without diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſimulation. For many times the motiue of ſinning is the faci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie of forgiuing. And it is a knowne caſe, that people by pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment become obedient; but by pardoning, proud and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolent. The ill and vicious, are ſo poſſeſſed and inabled in their vices, by their long continuance, that if Kings ſhould not ſhew ſome mettall and courage, they would poſſeſſe the world, and carry all things away before them, in that violent manner, that the good ſhould not be able to liue amongſt the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.<note place="margin">Bald. in l. Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uinciarum C, de ferijs.</note> By chaſtiſing the bad, (ſaith <hi>Baldus</hi>) the good liue in ſafety. And for this cauſe (and not in vaine) according to <hi>Plato,</hi> and others, were Lawes inſtituted, and regall power, the ſtroke of the ſword, the diſcipline of the Clergie, and the common hangmans whip, all of them as neceſſary for mans life, as thoſe 4. Elements, by which we liue &amp; breathe. Let Kings take this from me, and beleeue it, That that commonwealth is in great danger, where the Kings reputation goes decaying; and the force of Iuſtice looſeth it's ſtrength. For thereby vices aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume licence vnto themſelues; and their owners perſeuere,
<pb n="368" facs="tcp:180809:195"/>
and go on in them. Here a remiſſe Prince is a ſharpe ſword, and doth neuer more grieuouſly puniſh then when hee doth moſt pardon. Puniſhment and chaſtiſement onely offend the delinquent; but remiſſion, <hi>la ley, al Rey, y la Grey,</hi> the Law, King, and people. By remiſſion, Lawes and Kings grow in contempt, and the whole commonwealth infected. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as by chaſtiſement the Law is obeyed and kept; the King feared and honoured; and the kingdome maintained in peace and iuſtice. I doe not treat here of thoſe cruell and rigorous puniſhments which ſome ſeuere Iudges inflict, for remedies and cures of ſo much rigour, are violent, and do ſooner kill, and make an end of their Subiects, then heale and recouer them by little and little. Wherefore in point of correction, a commonwealth muſt vſe a great deale of caution and pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence. And for that hee who pretends by maine ſtrength to reſiſt the furious current of a ſwift riuer; or by roughneſſe, to tame a head-ſtrong horſe, ſhall ſhew himſelfe as inſolent, as impertinent; rigour with gentleneſſe, and iuſtice with mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie, will doe well: which if they go not hand in hand, and kiſſe each other, they are both but the occaſion of greater corruption. For it is an erronious diſcourſe in thoſe that thinke, that publike conſeruation conſiſteth in the execution of cruell chaſtiſements, and ſharpe and rigorous ſentences, bee they of death or otherwiſe; For theſe doe rather diſpeo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and deſolate, then correct and amend a kingdome. And as it is a ſigne of bad Phyſitians, or of a corrupt and infecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous aire, to ſee many fall ſicke, and dye; ſo likewiſe is it of careleſſe Miniſters, and ill preuention, and of a contagious corruption of vices, and euill manners, when there are many criminall iudgements, many puniſhments, and cruell cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtiſements. And who is he that knowes the principall cauſe thereof? it may bee this, or it may bee that, or all together, howſoeuer I am ſure it is all ill. And in a word, ſo great, ſo vniuerſall, and ſo pernicious an ill, that if Chriſtian Kings carry not a very watchfull eye ouer their Subiects manners,
<pb n="369" facs="tcp:180809:195"/>
in not ſuffering them to flie out, they ſhall not, when they would, be able to refraine them, and remedie what is amiſſe; for euill cuſtome being once habituated (according vnto <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len,</hi> and others) is an acquired nature, and engendreth an habite, which being mans naturall inclination, carries him along after it; and ſo great is his inclination to delights, and ſo many the prouocations, and ill examples which draw him thereunto, and poure oyle as it were vpon that fire, that if there be not the more diligence and care vſed in the quench<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of it, it muſt neceſſarily ſpread it ſelfe abroad, and extend it ſelfe daily more and more, and more eſpecially into thoſe Cities and countries where there is much commerce and trading in Merchandiſe, and in the Courts of Kings, where there is ſuch a concourſe of diuerſe and ſundrie nations, there being not any one of them which hath not it's proper and peculiar vertues, as alſo it's proper and peculiar vices. Their vertues men hardly take hold on; but their vices, thoſe cleaue eaſily vnto them of themſelues: and by this their Commerce and Trading, remaine engrauen in their hearts. And what was before but an inclination, being now become a cuſtome, vice engendreth vice; and one appetite maketh way for ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. <hi>Lycurgus</hi> ſaith, That it more importeth a State to ſee that it's Cities bee not infected with the ill cuſtomes and manners of Strangers, then to preſerue them from the plague, the peſtilence, or other the like contagious diſeaſes. For theſe, Time aſſwageth and conſumeth; but thoſe, are with time in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed and augmented. Three Embaſſadours of the Cretans, each of them being of a different Sect, made their ioynt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance into Rome. The Senate gaue them audience. And <hi>Cato</hi> being there, whom (for his great authoritie) they did much reuerence, and was indeed as an Oracle amongſt them, gaue his <hi>vote,</hi> and opinion, that hee would haue them diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patcht thence with all poſſible ſpeed, before the corruption of their manners ſhould corrupt the Romane Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="370" facs="tcp:180809:196"/>This care ought Kings to take; and ſo much the rather, for that they haue neuer a <hi>Cato,</hi> that will tell them; neuer a Councellour that will aduiſe them, that in no kinde of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, nor vpon any occaſion whatſoeuer, ought they either in their Court, or kingdome, ſuffer any man (no though hee be an Ambaſſadour) to reſide there, being different in his Religion, manners, and Ceremonies. For their treating and conuerſing with vs, ſerues to no other purpoſe, but to bring in vices, and baniſh vertues, to worke vpon weake and wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uering mindes, and to draw the naturall Subiects of another Prince, from Gods true worſhip, and due obſeruance of his diuine Law. And this was the care of the Ancients of thoſe times, who would neuer giue conſent and allowance, that there ſhould bee any thing intertained or receiued into their commonwealths, whereby mens mindes might grow cold, or be withdrawne in any one point or tittle from the worſhip and adoration of their Gods. And very fit for theſe times were that Law of the Perſians, which did puniſh him with death, that ſhould bring in any new vſe, or ſtrange cuſtome. And the Cretans, did in their ordinarie Letanies deſire, that no new cuſtome might enter into their city, which is as a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagious diſeaſe, and cleaueth as cloſe as the plague or peſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence. Nor did the Lawes of Egypt permit any new tune in their Muſicke, or any new kinde of ſong, vnleſſe they were firſt examined by thoſe that were in place of gouernment. For (as <hi>Plato</hi> affirmeth) a Commonwealth, as well as Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicke,<note place="margin">Plato Dial. <hi>2.</hi> de Legibus.</note> admitteth changes; And that for the auoiding of this miſchiefe, it ought not to be permitted, that there ſhould be introduced any new kinde of tunes, or Muſicke, together wherewith mens mindes receiue ſome change and alteration. <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> did aduiſe thoſe that would bee vertuous, that they ſhould not vſe Muſicke, nor muſicall inſtruments, to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite them to be vicious. For Muſicke being a diuine gift, and very powerfull to moue the hearts of men, and to perſwade the thing that is ſung, if they accuſtome themſelues to play
<pb n="371" facs="tcp:180809:196"/>
and ſing holy leſſons, &amp; honeſt ſongs, they therby accuſtome themſelues to be honeſt and vertuous. And therefore anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently your Kings, as <hi>Dauid,</hi> the Prophets, and Prieſts, the better to apply themſelues to contemplation, did vſe Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicke, wherewith they ſuſpended their ſenſes, and remained as it were ſwallowed vp in God. In a word, many men haue therewith beene robbed of their ſoules, and of their honours, and daily much hurt doth enſue thereby. For it is able to doe much, and greate is the force and power which it hath ouer mens manners. And if you will not beleeue me, obſerue but the hurt, which your new wanton tunes, together with the laſciuious wordes, and geſticulations vſed in them, haue wrought of late amongſt not onely the common, but better ſort of people.</p>
                  <p>Now to ſhut vp all that hath beene ſaid in three points. Firſt of all I ſay, that it much importeth, that a Prince bee good in himſelfe; for that all men make their Imitation after that patterne that hee ſets before them. And for this cauſe, God placed him in ſo high and eminent a place, to the end that by the reſplendour of his vertues, hee ſhould giue light to the whole kingdome; and that both by his life and exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, he ſhould exemplifie and indoctrinate his Subiects: for it is not onely included in the name and office of King, to rule and gouerne the kingdome by good and who ſome Lawes, but likewiſe to teach and inſtruct the people by his vertues. This ought to bee (ſay <hi>Socrates</hi> and <hi>Plato</hi>) the end and ayme of Kings, to direct their Subiects in the truth, they practiſing it firſt themſelues, which is the ſtrongeſt and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cibleſt argument to perſwade it. For the execution of that which is perſwaded and commanded, doth ſecure the paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage, doth make the worke ſauourie, and doth facilitate the trouble. Secondly, to the end that the Lawes may bee the better kept, Kings muſt obey, and keepe them; for it will ſeeme an vniuſt thing in them, to eſtabliſh and ordaine that, which themſelues will not keepe and obſerue.

doe as <hi>Lycurgus</hi> did, who neuer enacted any thing which he himſelfe did not punctually performe. And it was a Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Edict; <hi>Vſe el Rey de la Ley, que hiziere para la grey:</hi> Let the King that law keepe, which he makes for his ſheepe. Laſtly, that they bee very carefull and watchfull ouer the whole kingdome, but more particularly ouer the Court; for from thence is diffuſed all the good, or ill; as likewiſe in cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talling the exceſſes of apparrell, the ſuperfluities of feaſts and banquets, of gaming, of ſports, and paſtimes, of lightneſſe in behauiour, of licentiouſneſſe in courting of women, and of thoſe waſtefull expences which might very well be excuſed, in weddings, in iewells, and dreſſings both in the women and the men. Then began Rome to grow ranke in Luxurie, and prophaneneſſe, when your gilded bed-ſteds, your coſtly pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uilions, your ſtately canopies, your ritch hangings, your cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious tables, your glorious cupboords of plate, your gybing Ieſters, and your various Inſtruments of Muſicke were brought in, which were then in great vſe and requeſt, for to prouoke and ſtirre vp the appetite in thoſe their tedious and ſumptuous ſuppers; as if, for to go to hell, there were neede of ſuch a wind-lace, or wheeling about, the way being (as it is) ſo eaſie and direct, that a man may go it blindfold. Cauſes all of them of iuſt feare, and fore-runners likewiſe of the ruine and perdition of any Monarchy whatſoeuer, as they haue beene heretofore of others that haue been ouerthrowne by the like meanes.</p>
                  <p>But to conclude with this ſenſe, and to ſhut vp the doore likewiſe to all the reſt; wee are to preſuppoſe that, which is very common both in diuine and humane Letters, That by the hands, wherein particularly conſiſts the Touching, are vnderſtood workes; becauſe they are the Inſtruments by which they are done. <hi>Moſes</hi> deliuering vnto vs, that the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brewes did ſee the wonders which God had wrought in their fauour, ſaith, <hi>Viderunt manum magnam, quam exercuerat Dominus:</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Exod. 14.31.</note> They ſaw that great worke (which the originall
<pb n="375" facs="tcp:180809:197"/>
renders, that great hand) which the Lord exerciſed vpon the Aegyptians. And beſides this,<note place="margin">Pier. lib. <hi>35.</hi> Tit. Opus.</note> it hath another ſignification (as is obſerued by <hi>Pierius Valerianus</hi>) an open hand, being the Symbole of eloquence; expreſſing that efficacy, and perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiue power that lies in well couched words. Works and words being both very neceſſary in Kings, Execution in the one; and Elocution in the other. And becauſe all Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces cannot performe theſe offices of doing and ſaying, by themſelues, they muſt haue another tongue, and other hands, by which they muſt ſpeake, and doe; and the tongue whereby they muſt ſpeake, and the hands, whereby they muſt touch, and handle all things (for their owne are not able to doe it) muſt bee their fauourites. <hi>Policratus,</hi> in his booke directed to <hi>Traiane,</hi> ſaith, That your great Lords in Court, and Kings fauourites, are the hands of the kingdome. And, as in mans body, they are naturally diſpoſed, and ready prepared for to ſuccour and aſſiſt all the other members; ſo they ſhould be at hand for to helpe and relieue all the neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſities of the kingdome, and to be the formoſt in all dangers, and a thouſand other occaſions that will offer themſelues, which neither are, nor can bee wanting to Kings and king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes. And therefore the Philoſopher ſaid of the hands, that they are the Inſtrument of Inſtruments. For without them nothing can be done; neither can Kings of themſelues do all. They haue need of their Miniſters, and Fauourites, which are their feet, and their hands. In the ſubſequent Chapters, we ſhall diſcourſe ſomewhat a little of them. God grant, that little, or ſomewhat, what ere it bee, may worke ſome good. And firſt of all we will treate, whether it be fitting to haue Fauourites.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. XXXI.</hi> Whether it be fit for Kings to haue Fauourites.</head>
               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">F</seg>Auourites being (as they are) the work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manſhip of Kings, receiuing their forme and faſhion from their good liking; which creatures of their making, wee haue mentioned in the former Chapter. We ſhall handſomely fall here vpon that which in this is put to the queſtion. Nor is the anſwer thereunto very eaſie. For a Fauourite being of the ſame nature, as a particular friend, and friendſhip being to bee <hi>inter aequales,</hi> betweene thoſe that are of equall condition, it ſeemeth that thoſe that are Subiects and ſeruants to their King and Maſter can not hold it with him; whom they are to behold, and treate with, with a great deale of reuerence, reſpecting alwayes his royall Maieſtie, which (according to that other Poet) <hi>No cabe en vn ſaco con el Amor;</hi> is not in one and the ſame ſacke with loue. And without loue, there is no friendſhip. True it is that <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> and ſome other Philoſophers affirme, that this difference may eaſily bee reconciled, foraſmuch as hee that is in the higher and more eminent place, may ſtoope ſo low, and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhion himſelfe in that euen meaſure to his Inferiour, that they may both remaine vpon equall tearmes. But this can hardly ſquare and ſuite well with Kings towards their Fauourites. For, as it were an <hi>indecorum,</hi> and vnſeemely thing in a hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane bodie, that the head ſhould abaſe it ſelfe, and become equall with the ſhoulder; ſo, were it prodigious and mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrous, that Kings, which are Heads, and hold that Soue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigntie which God hath giuen them, ſhould ſtoope ſo low to their Subiects, that the eminencie ſhould not appeare which
<pb n="375" facs="tcp:180809:198"/>
they haue ouer them. And that other meanes which may be vſed in rayſing a ſubiect, or Fauorite to that hight that hee may be equall with his King, bringeth with that a great in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conuenience. For a Crowne &amp; Scepter royall, cannot endure any fellowſhip with equality. And therefore theſe two meanes may pare and fit well with friends, that hauing pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed friendſhip, when their eſtates were equall, the one growes inferiour to the other, eyther good fortune, or good diligence, hauing preferred his fellow and friend. But with Kings there cannot be held this correſpondency and equality. And it is King <hi>Salomons</hi> counſaill, who ſaith; That it is not fitting for any man to entertaine friendſhip and communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, with thoſe that are too mighty. <hi>Ditiori te, ne ſocius fueris; Quid communicabit cacabus ad ollam? Quando enim ſe colliſerint, confringetur:</hi> Haue no fellowſhip with one that is mightier and richer then thy ſelfe. For how agree the Kettle and the earthen Pot together? For, if the one bee ſmitten againſt the other, it ſhall be broken. And againe, if you will but diligently obſerue the ſacred hiſtory of the Kings which were ouer Gods people, you ſhall there finde little mention of Fauorites. On the other ſide, it will like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe ſeeme vnreaſonable, that kings ſhould be debarr'd that, without which (to all mens ſeeming) mans life cannot bee well paſt ouer. <hi>Nemo ſine amicis, ſpectet vinere;</hi> (ſaid the ſaid Philoſopher) Let no man looke to liue without friends. And the holy Scriptures are full of the commoditie, and benefit, which faithfull friends afford, being as neceſſary for the life of man, as fire, and water; and for no eſtate ſo important, as for that of Kings, who for that they haue ſo many, ſo weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and ſo ſecret buſineſſes, their eſtate were intollerable, and more then they were able to beare, if they might not haue the libertie of hauing friends, with whom they might communicate, and by whom they might receiue ſome eaſe, of thoſe troubles, and care, which great offices (ordinarily) bring with them.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="376" facs="tcp:180809:199"/>Now for to giue ſatisfaction vnto that which is here pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to be auerred, we are to conſider, That <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> and other, both Philoſophers and Diuines teach (which is no more then what experience plainly prooues vnto vs) That there are two ſorts of Loue, or friendſhip; The one Intereſſall, or <hi>cum foenore,</hi> whoſe end, is its proper profit. The other hath with it a more gentile &amp; noble intent, which is, to loue and wiſh well to that which deſerueth to bee belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued: and this is called <hi>Amor amicitiae,</hi> the loue of friendſhip. The other, <hi>Amor concupiſcentiae,</hi> the loue of concupiſcence. And with very good reaſon, for that therein there is not to be found the face of true friendſhip. From theſe two Loues, as from two diuerſe rootes, ſpring forth two different ſorts of Fauorites. The one, who for their great parts and quail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties haue deſerued to carry after them, not only the good wills and affections of their equals, but euen of Kings them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues. And when theſe abilities are ſo extraordinary and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uantagious, no man can deeme it inconuenient that Kings ſhould more particularly, and in a more extraordinary man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, apply their affection vnto them. Nay, it would rather lay a ſpot and blemiſh vpon them, if notice ſhould be taken, that they equally entertaine all, or not eſteeme and prize them moſt that merit moſt to be eſteemed. For in all good reaſon; there is no greater inequality, then to equall all alike.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Plato</hi> ſaid very well, That there is not any virtue of that force and efficacie, for to catch and ſteale away mens hearts. Nor herein doe we need the teſtimonies of Philoſophers, for the holy Ghoſt ſaith, <hi>Vt mors, eſt dilectio,</hi> loue is ſtrong as death. The coales thereof are coales of fire, which hath a moſt vehement flame, it beares all away before it. And in this its force and ſtrength, friendſhip and loue are much alike. And building on this ground, I ſay; That very well there may be ſaid to bee friendſhip betweene a King and a Fauorite; for that their ſoules haue in their birth and begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, or (as I may ſay, their firſt originall) equall nobleneſſe.
<pb n="377" facs="tcp:180809:199"/>
And your nobleſt friendſhip proceeds from the ſoule. Very famous and much celebrated was that friendſhip betwixt Prince <hi>Ionathan</hi> (the onely heire of the kingdome) and that worthy noble <hi>Dauid.</hi> And ſo great was the loue that was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene them, that the ſacred Scripture ſaith,<note place="margin">1. <hi>Reg.</hi> 18.2.</note> That <hi>anima Ionathae conglutinata erat animae Dauid, &amp; dilexit eum Iona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thas quaſi animam ſuam.</hi> The ſoule of <hi>Ionathan</hi> was knit with the ſoule of <hi>Dauid;</hi> and that <hi>Ionathan</hi> loued him, as his owne ſoule. And I further affirme, that it is very fit and conuenient that Kings ſhould loue thoſe with aduantage, that haue the aduantage of others in vertue, wiſedome, and learning. And ſuch ſhould be thoſe, that ſerue and attend the perſons of Princes; for ordinarily, out of that Nurſery are theſe plants your Fauourites drawne. When <hi>Nabuchadnezzar,</hi> King of Babilon, beſieged and tooke by force of armes the Citie of Ieruſalem, he carried away from thence great ſpoiles of gold and ſiluer; but that, which hee much more prized then all this Treaſure, were the ſonnes of the chiefeſt Noblemen, and ſuch as were lineally deſcended of the Kings of that kingdome; and gaue eſpeciall order, that they ſhould chooſe and cull out thoſe that had the beſt and ableſt parts, both of nature and acquiſition; thoſe that were of the beſt diſpoſition, the moſt learned, and beſt taught, to the end that being ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied with theſe good qualities, they might merit to attend in the Court and Chamber of the King.<note place="margin">Dan. 1.3.</note> 
                  <hi>Et ait Rex Aſphenez Praepoſito Eunuchorum, vt introduceret de filijs Iſrael, &amp; de ſemine Regio, &amp; Tyrannorum pueros, in quibus nulla eſſet macula, decoros forma, &amp; eruditos omni ſapientia, cautos ſcientia, &amp; doctos diſciplina, &amp; qui poſſent ſtare in pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latio Regis:</hi> And the King ſpake vnto <hi>Aſhpenez,</hi> the Maſter of his Eunuchs, that hee ſhould bring certaine of the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of Iſrael, and of the Kings ſeed, and of the Princes; Children in whom was no blemiſh, but well-fauoured, and skilfull in all wiſedome, and cunning in knowledge, and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding, Science, and ſuch as had abilitie in them to ſtand
<pb n="378" facs="tcp:180809:200"/>
in the Kings palace. And this election fell out ſo luckily, and proued to be of that profit and benefit, that amongſt thoſe which (indewed with theſe qualities) were made choice of, for to ſerue the King, there were three of them did excell, but one more then all the reſt, not onely in vertue, but in the knowledge likewiſe of ſecret buſineſſes, and matters of State and gouernment, which was <hi>Daniel;</hi> who ſo well deſerued to be a Fauourite to thoſe Kings of Babylon, and more eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially to <hi>Darius,</hi> that hee did not content himſelfe with ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king him onely a priuie Councellour, but the prime man amongſt them. For hauing ſet ouer the kingdome an 120. Princes, which ſhould bee ouer the whole kingdome, and ouer theſe, three Preſidents (of whom, <hi>Daniel</hi> was firſt) that the Princes might giue account vnto them, that the King might haue no damage; And as hee was the greateſt Subiect and Fauourite in the world, ſo was hee ſuperiour in the vertues and qualities of his perſon. <hi>Igitur Daniel ſupera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bat omnes Principes &amp; ſatrapas, quia Spiritus Domini am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plior erat in illo:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Dan. 6.3.</note> Therefore was <hi>Daniel</hi> preferred before the Preſidents and Princes, becauſe an excellent ſpirit was in him. The holy Scripture likewiſe tells vs, that <hi>Ioſeph</hi> was ſuch a Fauourite of King <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> that hee gaue him abſolute power ouer all his kingdome, and commanded, that in pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like pompe he ſhould ride in the Kings owne Chariot, and in his owne ſeate, and haue a Crier go before to proclaime the fauour that the King was pleaſed to doe him. <hi>Dixit quoque Rex Aegypti ad Ioſeph;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Gen. 41.44.</note> 
                  <hi>Ego ſum Pharaoh, abſque tuo impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rio non mouebit quiſquam manum, aut pedem in omni terra.</hi> And <hi>Pharaoh</hi> ſaid vnto <hi>Ioſeph,</hi> I am <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> and without thee ſhall no man lift vp his hand, or foot, in all the land of Aegypt. And well did hee deſerue this honour, for by his great induſtrie and wiſedome, he freed that King and king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome from that terrible famine, beſides thoſe many other great and troubleſome imployments, wherein he was buſied for the ſpace of ſeuen yeares together. In the fourth booke of
<pb n="379" facs="tcp:180809:200"/>
kings, we reade that <hi>Naaman,</hi> who was Captaine of the hoſt of the King of Syria, was the onely Fauourite of the King; <hi>Erat vir magnus apud Dominum ſuum, &amp; honoratum:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">4. <hi>Reg.</hi> 5.1.</note> Hee was a great man with his Maſter, and honourable. And ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering the reaſon of this his great priuacie with his King, and the honour he had done him, it is there ſpecified; <hi>Per illum enim dedit dominus ſalutem Syriae; erat enim vir fortis.</hi> Becauſe by him the Lord had giuen deliuerance vnto Syria; and was alſo a mighty man in valour. For all the life and ſoule that kingdome had, came from him, God vſing him as his inſtrument for his puiſance and prudence. And when Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uourites are of theſe aduantagtous abilities, thoſe reaſons and inconueniences doe ceaſe (before mentioned) touching the diſequalitie of Kings, with their Inferiours. For vertue hath this excellence and preheminence; that from the very duſt of the earth it doth lift vp men vnto honour, and doth raiſe them to that height, that it equalls them, and ſets them cheeke by iole with the greateſt Princes in the world.<note place="margin">Eccl: 11.1.</note>

A wiſe ſeruant ſhall haue rule ouer a ſonne that cauſeth ſhame.<note place="margin">Prou. 17.2.</note> So great is the force of wiſedome and diſcretion, that it doth not onely exalt, and raiſe to greatneſſe, men that are free borne (though in a poore meane cottage) but brings euen the baſeſt ſlaues to bee Lords ouer their owne Maſters. A certaine Philoſopher being taken captiue, was brought forth into the open Market to bee ſold, and they that were to buy him, demanded of him, what hee could doe; He told them, That the beſt thing that he was skild in, was, to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand his Maſters. In many places of Scripture, is repeated and confirmed the Teſtimonie of King <hi>Salomons</hi> great power and wiſedome; And amongſt other things, which are men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned of the Maieſtie of his houſe and Court, it is ſaid; That therein he had a great many Princes, whoſe names are regiſtred in the third booke of the Kings. And amongſt them there is but one onely that is made remarkable by the name and title of the Kings Fauourite and friend. <hi>Zabud, filius Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than, amicus Regis;</hi> And <hi>Zabud,</hi> the ſonne of <hi>Nathan,</hi> was principall Officer, and the Kings friend. Some Tranſlations in the place of principall Officer, put Prieſt. And theſe two titles of Prieſt, and the Kings friend, are therefore thus ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned together, that they may giue vs to vnderſtand, that the friendſhip and affection towards a Fauourite, ſhould take it's growth from that learning and vertue which is annexed to the ſtate and condition of the Prieſt. And in the firſt booke of the Chronicles, in that Catalogue, which is there made of thoſe which bare principall offices in King <hi>Dauids</hi> Court, it is onely ſaid of <hi>Huſhai</hi> the Archite, that hee was the Kings companion. And in the ſecond booke of the Kings, are ſet downe at large the great and many reaſons, why <hi>Huſhai</hi> on his part might well deſerue this Title. Our Sauiour Chriſt likewiſe ſeemed to make ſhew of his more particular affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to <hi>Peter, Iohn,</hi> and <hi>Iames,</hi> making choice of them from among the twelue, to retire himſelfe in priuate with them, and to make them witneſſes of his glorious transfiguration; and
<pb n="381" facs="tcp:180809:201"/>
afterwards of diuers other particular things. Whence it ſeemeth that they might haue the name of Fauourites; but not without great grounds, and thoſe extraordinary vertues, wherein they out-ſhined others. Howbeit the choiſe and ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of this ſupreme King, is not to bee ruled and meaſured out by that of the Kings of this world; for they can not by the alone power of their loue better men, nor affoord them neceſſary parts, whereby to merit to bee their friends. But this true King and Lord of all, in placing his good will and affection on thoſe whom hee is pleaſed to make choice of for his friends, doth likewiſe indow and adorne them with ſtrong abilities, whereby to bee accounted worthy of his friendſhip and fauour. Whereas with the Fauourites of the Kings of this world, it fareth cleane contrary. For thoſe, which before they were Fauourites, were good and honeſt, by their priuacie, and great power with their King, haue come to be ſtarke nought; and the more footing they haue in the Kings friendſhip, they are vſually the leſſe worthy of it.

<pb n="382" facs="tcp:180809:202"/>
alſo of all Chriſtian ſoules. The other loue is that which euery one beareth to himſelfe, in that high manner and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe, that it reacheth euen to the contemning and deſpiſing of God. And from this is built that City of Babylon, which is as much to ſay, as Confuſion; &amp; ſignifieth that, which euery ſinner hath within himſelf, as alſo that which is in ill ordered commonwealths. And therefore (as wee ſaid in the former Chapter) that from thoſe two Loues of friendſhip and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupiſcence, did iſſue forth two ſorts of Fauourites: The one good and profitable; the other, bad and couetous: So, conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering Loue, not in reſpect of outward things, but in reſpect of it ſelfe, it differenceth the vſe of Fauourites, according to the different meanes and ends, wherewith, and for which they are made choice of: And the vſe likewiſe, which they make thereof, when they ſee they are thus aduanced, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued into fauour. The meanes haue the denomination of their goodneſſe, or badneſſe, from their end. Whence it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth, that when Kings ſhall make choice of their Fauo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rites by good meanes, not out of a ſelfe-humour, or wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maniſh kinde of longing, nor for to pleaſe his owne proper affection, but that they may comply the better with thoſe obligations, which they haue to the good diſpatch of buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes, and to haue one to helpe them to beare the burthen that lies vpon them; As this end is good, ſo of force muſt the meanes likewiſe bee. For to obtaine good ends, bad meanes are not taken. And therefore Kings ſhall doe well, in taking ſuch Fauourites vnto them, as ſhall bee ſollicitous, and care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full in the diſpatching of buſineſſes, faithfull in their ſeruices, and endowed with ſuch parts afore ſpecified, as were thoſe Fauourites, recommended vnto you in the former Chapter. For <hi>Ioſeph</hi> (as we told you) grew in fauour with King <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raoh,</hi> for his great wiſedome, and for his ſupernaturall know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of things to come, and reuealing ſuch ſecret myſteries as other his Miniſters could not tell what to make of them. The like befell <hi>Daniel,</hi> with the Caldean, and Macedonian
<pb n="383" facs="tcp:180809:202"/>
Kings; for before euer he became a Fauourite, they ſaw his great wiſedome and conſtancie in the true ſeruice of his God, his ſingular prudence, and thoſe other his good gifts, which are recorded in the booke of his propheſies. The extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary graces of <hi>Peter, Iohn,</hi> and <hi>Iames,</hi> who is he that is igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of them? Being that the Euangeliſts ſay of Saint <hi>Peter,</hi> that his extraordinary loue was examined, and proued in thoſe ſo often repeated queſtions: <hi>Petre amas me? Simon Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hannis, diligis me plus his?</hi> And againe, <hi>Simon Iohannis, amas me?</hi> And the Apoſtle Saint <hi>Iames</hi> was the firſt of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, that by his bloud and death gaue teſtimonie of this his loue. And Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> ſhewed no leſſe, at his laſt Supper, at his paſſion, and at the foote of the Croſſe, hauing followed and accompanied his Maſter euen to his death, when the reſt fled and forſooke him. But when Kings make not choice of their Fauourites for the foreſaid ends, and for the publike good, but for their owne particular guſts and humours, and to let looſe the reines with more libertie and freedome to their owne delights and pleaſures, ſuch kinde of Fauourites ſet vſually before them the ſame ends, and commonly preferre their owne priuate guſtes and intereſts before thoſe of their Kings, or the publike good of the commonwealth, and come to be the firebrands and deſtruction of States. This leſſon the holy Scripture doth likewiſe teach vs, whoſe myſteries are ſo high and ſo deepe, that euen in that which it ſilenceth, it ſpeaketh vnto vs; and in ſaying little, inſtructeth much. I haue much obſerued that which is recounted in the Hiſtory of <hi>Eſther,</hi> touching the priuacie of that proud and vnfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate <hi>Haman,</hi>

                  </note> whom King <hi>Aſſuerus</hi> raiſed from ſo low a degree, and from ſo wicked a race, as he came of. For (accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to <hi>Ioſephus</hi>) he deſcended from that Amalakite whom the Prophet <hi>Samuel</hi> cauſed to be hewen in peeces. And for that it is the condition of Kings, when they once begin to fauour a man, to make him like froath to riſe and ſwell, this fauourite grew to that heighth through his Kings grace and
<pb n="384" facs="tcp:180809:203"/>
fauour, that all the Subiects of that Monarch reſpected him as a God, and kneeled downe in his preſence, his perſon being much more adored, ſerued, and feared, then the Kings; becauſe the King had put the ſtaffe (as they ſay) into his hands, giuing him the abſolute command ouer all his eſtates; inſomuch that neither in, nor out of Court, nor elſewhere, was there ought done, but by the order of <hi>Haman;</hi> and the King himſelfe held him in the place of a father. And for that Vanitie is the daughter of Pride, all this his great fauour and priuacie with his Prince, did but make the more for his owne hurt, as doth the Ants wings, for hers; or like thoſe of <hi>Icarus,</hi> which being of waxe, the nearer they came to the Sunne, the ſooner they melted, working then his death and downfall, when he was at the higheſt. For <hi>Haman</hi> came to hang, and dye on that gallowes which he had prouided for <hi>Mardoche,</hi> and for no other offence in the world, but becauſe he would not bowe the knee vnto him, and adore him as the reſt did. So that (if you marke the Storie) <hi>Hamans</hi> owne greatneſſe and power was the axe, which did frame and hew out that gallowes, whereon himſelfe was hanged. And hauing often thought with my ſelfe on this mans end, and conſidering likewiſe the beginning of this his priuacie, I doe not finde, that it was for the excellencie of his merits, or for any heroi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call vertues that were in him; ſuch as were thoſe which King <hi>Pharaoh, Nabuchadnezzar,</hi> and <hi>Darius</hi> did conſider in thoſe their Fauourites, which they made choice of, but for ſome particular guſte and liking, that his King tooke to him. For the Scripture ſpeakes not one word, nor maketh not any the leaſt mention of the merits of this Fauourite, nor of any notable thing, that hee had done either for the good of the kingdome, or the ſeruice of his King; but rather without any preambles to that purpoſe, in the very entrance of the third Chapter we reade thus. <hi>Rex Aſſuerus exaltauit Aman, filium Amadathi,</hi>

And all the Kings ſeruants, that were in the Kings gate, bowed, and reuerenced <hi>Haman.</hi> And in this ſo true a relation, and ſo fully ſetting forth the priuacie of this great Fauorite, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any foundation or ground of deſert; the Scripture there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by hath inſtructed vs, how inconſiderately this King did proceed in the choice which he made. But he did correct this his errour, by opening his eyes, and inflicting that puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment vpon him which he deſerued, and is there ſet downe. I could wiſh that Fauourites would likewiſe open their eyes, and conſider with themſelues, that the happines which they hold, is but borrowed ware, lent vnto them but for a ſhort time, and that they neither vſe, nor poſſeſſe it as their owne proper good or inheritance. And being that by one meanes or other, it muſt leaue them, that they would not wholly giue themſelues ouer thereunto; for it forſaketh few without their finall ruine. Let them bite vpon this bit, and with the remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance thereof, bridle their pride and inſolencie, leſt (how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer they flatter themſelues) that hand may pull them downe, which raiſed them vp. For there are ſome, which will neuer be able to indure this their felicitie and happineſſe, but one way or other, will worke their ouerthrow, and make them pay the price of their ambition at too deare a rate: Nay the King himſelfe will ſometimes put to his helping hand, as we ſee King <hi>Aſſuerus</hi> did, who after that hee had made <hi>Haman</hi> his onely Fauourite, and raiſed him to that highth of honour, as could not well bee more, turned his face from him, and did ſo much diſtaſte him, for his ſower and inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent behauiour, that for to make him ſtoope and hang the head, he commanded him to be hanged vpon the ſame gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes that he had ſet vp for another, who had deſerued well both of the King and State. The Emperour <hi>Alexander</hi> did
<pb n="386" facs="tcp:180809:204"/>
the like, who waxing wearie of the arrogancie of one of his Fauourites, and not being able longer to endure it, cauſed him to be ſtaked, and the ſtake to be ſet on the top of an high hill; giuing him a death anſwerable to his vanitie. For, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though Kings loue them, and in ſome ſort acknowledge a kinde of beholdingneſſe, yet they vſually withdraw their fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour quite from them, and are oftentimes aſhamed of their choice; whereunto being added the complaints of the people, and other principall perſons, offended with the iniuries offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed vnto them, remoue that ſcandall, by remouing their Fauo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite, and make them ſatisfaction by making him be puniſhed, neuer in this caſe aduiſing with any, nor ſo much as hearing what the Fauourite in his owne diſcharge can ſay for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe; for in ſuch deſperate caſes, when things are brought to that extremitie, Kings vſe to take that courſe as your <hi>Preto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medici,</hi> and skilfuller ſort of Phyſitians doe with their infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riours who in weightie and vrgent occaſions fall ſpeedily to worke themſelues, without any further conſultation; but in ordinarie diſeaſes, heare, reſolue, and conſult with others. Againe, let Fauourites, for their learning, reade the Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, and peruſe the generall booke of Time, and they ſhall there finde a thouſand of theſe examples, and other as many faire warnings, worthy their ſight and knowledge, for the admoniſhing of men, for to feare their priuacie with Kings, and to tremble at humane proſperitie, and the ſecuritie wherein they liue. And hee that ſhall diligently reade theſe things, will ſeeke to come fairely off from theſe his high for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes and fauours. For ordinarily, from a proſperous and high-raiſed eſtate, great diſaſters haue had their beginning; as from your higheſt places come your greateſt falls. And peraduenture becauſe this <hi>deſenganno,</hi> and diſ-deceiuing of our ſelues, doth ſo much import mankinde, and that men might liue in this feare, God hath and doth permit of ſuch like examples, and admonitions.

For, as the Apoſtle Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> and faith teacheth vs; all is ſubiect to Gods view; and vnto Kings, who are his Lieutenants here vpon earth, nothing can conuene ſo well with them, as to ſeeme to the world, to haue ſo quicke and large a fight, that they may ſee all whatſoeuer mans capacitie is able to reach vnto. And becauſe they cannot doe this alone by themſelues, <hi>Xe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nophon</hi> ſaid very well and wiſely, that it was needfull, that they ſhould haue other eyes, whereunto to truſt as much, as vnto their owne, and to ſee as it were by ſpectacles; for Kings are ſo vnhappy, that they cannot come to ſee all without them. And thoſe (as the ſame Philoſopher ſaid) are thoſe friends and Fauourites, who are to ſee, and know that which paſſeth in the world, as alſo what is needfull in common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealths, and to giue notice thereof vnto their Kings, and to helpe them to ordaine, and execute that, which is fitting and
<pb n="388" facs="tcp:180809:205"/>
conuenient. And Fauourites being intertained (as we ſaid be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore) for this end, and for the publike good of the common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth, it is requiſite that Kings ſhould not haue one onely, but many. One day, ſome about the perſon of <hi>Alexander</hi> the Great, ſhewed him a maruellous faire Pomegranate, which being cut in two, diſcouered a great company of kernels: and one of them asking him, of what he would wiſh to haue ſuch ſtore, as of thoſe Pomegranate kernels which appeared vnto him? He anſwered, that he would wiſh that hee might haue ſo many <hi>Zopiri;</hi> This <hi>Zopirus</hi> being a Fauourite of his, and one that was very faithfull vnto him, and of great abilities. For, it is not contrary to royall greatneſſe, to haue many, but very neceſſary for the better diſpatch of buſineſſes. For if they ſhould paſſe onely through the hands of the Prince, their diſpatch would bee very ſlow, and ſubiect likewiſe to many errours, whereinto they would ordinarily runne, for want of their care and aſſiſtance. <hi>Darius,</hi> King of Perſia, tooke three Fauourites vnto him, to whom the reſt of the Princes rendered an account of all the affaires of the kingdome. And from the beginning of the world, euen to this preſent time, Kings haue had, ſome more, and others leſſe. For this muſt be regulated and ordered according to the greatneſſe of the kingdomes. For by how much the more they are in number and greatneſſe, ſo much the more increaſe haue thoſe weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie affaires which are neceſſarily to haue their recourſe to their royall perſons; and according to the meaſure of them, is there an addition to be made of thoſe, that are to aſſiſt and attend buſineſſes, to paſſe through all, to prouide for all, and in all places. The people of Iſrael, when <hi>Moſes</hi> gouerned them, were all ioyntly together in one body in forme of an Armie; and all that made not vp ſo much as a meane king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome; and they remaining (as then they did) without poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſions, incamped in a deſart, and being all Iſraelites, it ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth in all likelihood, that their ordinary buſineſſes could not be either ſo many, or ſo great, as thoſe which are incident
<pb n="389" facs="tcp:180809:205"/>

Let Kings therefore haue many for to aide and helpe them, and let them be the Miniſters of his minde, and the Conducts whereby to conuay his will and pleaſure to his Subiects. For in the adminiſtration of pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like affaires, it is euermore to bee indeauoured, that many beare a part therein; As well for the common ſatisfaction, that ſhall thereby be giuen vnto all; as alſo for that they may be able to make the better account of all buſineſſes, bee they neuer ſo many. And likewiſe, for that few being inſtructed and experienced in them, occaſion may not bee giuen, that (thoſe failing) the commonwealth and publike gouernment may thereby incurre any danger. This was <hi>Auguſtus</hi> his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit, deliuered by <hi>Suetonius;</hi> which that he might the better execute, and that his bounty might inlarge it ſelfe towards the more perſons; he inuented new publike Offices, wherein to imploy them. But I do not ſpeake this, as inferring there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by, that there ſhould bee ſo many, but that at leaſt (for the foreſaid reaſons) there ſhould bee ſome: And in concluſion, more then one, becauſe it will bee more eaſie to negotiate with them, and leſſe coſtly and troubleſome; and bee a meanes, that the Prince may be the better eaſed, and freed in great part of thoſe cares and troubles, which otherwiſe muſt needs weary him out, and worke his vnreſt and diſquiet. For his body is not made of braſſe, nor can he occurre to all oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion; Beſides, being more then one, their competition will make them the more both carefull and fearefull: as know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that in caſe they ſhall grow careleſſe, there are perſons enough beſides of ſufficiencie to ſupply their place; Whereas
<pb n="390" facs="tcp:180809:206"/>
the opinion and conceit of the contrary, puffes him vp with pride, and vndoes it's Maſter. For they fondly and fooliſhly perſwade themſelues, that their King and Maſter cannot liue and ſubſiſt without the aſſiſtance of their wit, and that there is not that fault they commit, but muſt be forgiuen them, out of the neceſſitie of their ſeruice. Forgetting in the meane while, that their King may imagine them to bee dead, and how that in ſuch a caſe, though it grieue him, yet muſt hee prouide himſelfe of others. Let Kings therefore bee beaten from this their errour, for he that ſhall otherwiſe aduiſe them, and ſeeke to be the onely man in their fauour and ſeruice, and take vnto himſelfe both the right ſide and the left, thruſting all others from thence, and gouerning both high and low, letting nothing eſcape his fingers, which hee pretendeth out of the neceſſary vſe of his perſon, and ſo abſolutely to become Maſter of their wills, and to haue that hand ouer their Kings, that they muſt not looke vpon any, but with their Fauorites eyes; ſuch a Fauourite (I ſay) pretends to tyrannize a king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, and by little and little will go cruſhing the Princes of the bloud, the ancient Nobilitie; and ſuch as are of power to ſtand in their way, thruſting this man out of Court to day, and that other to morrow, that hee alone may rule all with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any contradiction or oppoſition in the world. Let euery man ſay or thinke as they liſt, for mine owne part I am per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded that this is his maine end and drift; And the cauſe thereof is his feare of falling; knowing (beſides his owne conſciouſnes) that there are not onely one or two, but many in Court, that are able to ſupply his place, and farre better deſeruing then himſelfe. Your Alchymiſts make gold: But how? Onely in the colour; they will not let it come to the Touch, nor any other reall Eſſay; neither will they endure to haue it compared with any other minerall gold, for feare leſt it ſhould bee diſcouered, that theirs hath no more but a bare ſhew and apparence. Let Princes therefore aſſure themſelues, that thoſe Fauourites are but Alchimiſts, that will not admit
<pb n="391" facs="tcp:180809:206"/>
of any other companie, as being priuie to themſelues, that their vnderſtanding is not ſuch pure gold, that it can abide the Touch, nor any reall Eſſay. But ſay it ſhould paſſe for currant, and that their mindes were all made of pure gold, me thinkes they ſhould aduiſe and conſider with themſelues, that thoſe that are ingenious and wiſe men, will therefore the rather deſire that there ſhould be many: for, by comparing the one with the other, the true light ſhineth the more, and makes it ſelfe knowne whether it be ſo or no. And onely your fooles, and ſuch as are vnworthy of that they poſſeſſe, are iealous of that good, which they feare to looſe, when by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring they ſhall come to be knowne. God did not in vaine place ſo many members in mans bodie, and moſt of them double; had it not beene thereby to teach vs, that many are needfull in humane actions: and that one is not able to doe all, without an infinite deale of toyle, extraordinary ſpend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of his ſpirits, and the ſudden waſting and conſuming of his body. And here will ſuite very well to this our purpoſe, that which <hi>Tiberius</hi> affirmed, when feigning not to bee wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to accept of the Empire, hee ſaid, (going about the buſh to diſcouer the mindes of the Romane Nobilitie, and Senate) that he alone of himſelfe, was not ſufficient nor yet with the helpe of another, for ſo great a gouernment. Whereupon, <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſtius Criſpus</hi> taking his Qu, a great Fauourite of his, ſtarts mee vp, and makes me a long <hi>Harenga,</hi> or artificiall oration; ſhewing that Signiorie and Empire could not well conſiſt, without being conferred vpon one particular perſon (which is the maine foundation and ground-worke of the good and ſafetie of a Monarchicall gouernment) and that therein him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe (if no body elſe would take the paines) would bee as it were another <hi>Ioſeph,</hi> his faithfull Vice gerent: leſt the reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution of things, depending on the will of many, it might cauſe a diſtraction in buſineſſes, either by way of competi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or of paſſion. In concluſion, after <hi>Tiberius</hi> had heard this, and had throughly ſounded their mindes, he tooke oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion
<pb n="392" facs="tcp:180809:207"/>
to tell them, That in ſuch a Citie as Rome was, ſuſtai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and vpheld by ſo many and ſuch illuſtrious perſons, it was not fit that the buſineſſes of State ſhould be remitted to one man alone, for many would much more eaſily execute the offices and affaires of the commonwealth by a fellow-bearing of the burthen. For, as vnitie in ſome degrees is both profitable and pleaſing; ſo in other ſome it is hatefull, and preiudiciall. And therefore, (out of this conſideration) I ſay, That a King, as the ſupreme perſon, and principall Head of a kingdome, ought to be one alone. For the couetouſneſſe of ruling being inſatiable, and the nature of power incommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable, it is not poſſible that two Princes of equall authoritie ſhould continue any long time, but both of them ſuffer in the end, or at leaſt the buſineſſes that are committed to their charge. But for Fauourites, there may bee two, or three, or more, the vnitie remaining reſerued for the greater and ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>premer perſon. And likewiſe this pluralitie will not be much amiſſe; for if any one of them ſhall by ſome accident faile, there be others, whom the King knoweth, and they know him, that are fit for his ſeruice, and that haue good experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence and knowledge of buſineſſes, and all ſuch matters as are current and paſſable in the commonwealth, without being driuen to ſeeke out new Miniſters, or to inſtruct them what to doe in a time of neceſſitie, when things go not well, but ſtand in ill Tearmes, laying otherwiſe hold on the firſt that offer themſelues vnto them, to the ouerthrowing of the buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes in hand, and the proper hurt and dammage of their Lord and Maſter; at whoſe coſt and by meere erring in great matters, they muſt come to get their learning. Let Kings (a Gods name) reſerue for themſelues thoſe buſineſſes that are of greateſt importance (for in this likewiſe muſt there bee a ſetled courſe and order) as is in all well gouerned kingdomes. Referring (as we ſaid before) to the ordinary Councells and Tribunalls, ordinary buſineſſes, conſulting with their Kings thoſe that are of moſt importance; And theſe Kings by
<pb n="393" facs="tcp:180809:207"/>
themſelues (as before mentioned) ought to diſpatch, if there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in they be not hindered by default of their health, and not to remit and referre them to their Fauourites; who, in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of Iuſtice (were it but diſtributiue) ſhould haue no kinde of power. For thereby they oppreſſe thoſe Tribunalls and ſeates of iuſtice, together with their Miniſters and Officers, who, for that they know, they muſt haue much dependancy on the Fauourite; if he ſhall haue a hand in Courts of Iuſtice, and diſtribution of Offices, cannot but remaine much op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed, and debarred of their libertie, and the more, if they haue any pretenſion for their owne intereſt, or increaſing of their eſtate and honour. And the reaſon of all this will plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly appeare, if wee will but weigh thoſe words of the wiſe man; <hi>Per me Reges regnant,</hi>

Whereby is giuen to vnderſtand, the particular fauour which God giues to the lawfull Kings and Gouernours of their kingdomes and commonwealths, to hit right in that which appertaineth vnto gouernment. And therefore was it well ſaid of that wiſe King <hi>Salomon;</hi>

And your Diuines are of opinion, that Kings haue more helpe and aide from their Angels of guard, then other men haue. And beſides all this, the publike pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers that are poured forth throughout all their kingdomes and Prouinces, are of moſt great vſe for Gods illightning of their vnderſtanding. And therefore for theſe reaſons aforeſaid, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though your Fauourites and more ſecret Councellours of State may be very learned and wiſe vnderſtanding men, yet is there a great deale of reaſon, why in graue and weightie cauſes, they ſhould craue and attend their Kings opinion; eſteeming it as the more certaine, being it comes from a head, ſo much fauoured by God, and ſo well aſſiſted and ſtrength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened on all ſides. Which doth not concurre in Fauourites;
<pb n="394" facs="tcp:180809:208"/>
for God hath not made that promiſe vnto them, as he hath vnto Kings; nor (peraduenture) doe they deſerue it. And if he bee the ſole and onely Fauourite, much leſſe can hee pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume, that either his opinion or paines can be greater or ſurer then that of ſo many learned Councellours and Councells, that haue met and ſate thereupon, and haue ſpent ſo much time and ſtudie in State affaires. Nor is it to bee imagined, that when Councellours doe conſult, and craue their Kings opinion and reſolution, that they doe it to that end, that they ſhould receiue it from another inferiour perſon; whom let Kings loue them neuer ſo much, or conferre all that they can vpon them, they cannot giue them more vnderſtanding, or more knowledge, nor a better minde and diſpoſition, then what they haue already; for this is reſerued for God onely, as alſo it properly belongeth vnto him to giue light vnto Kings, that they may giue a fitting and direct anſwer to that point wherein they are conſulted, who alwayes ſupplyes them with that knowledge which is needfull for them, if they ſhall but begge it at his hands, and make good vſe thereof. Hence are two things inferred, which are very ſure and true. The firſt, That Kings are bound in conſcience to attend in their owne perſon graue and weightie buſineſſes; for that this is their principall office; which is euidently proued by this reaſon. Whoſoeuer beares an Office, and hath ſalarie for the ſame, is thereby obliged to comply fully therewith, <hi>Sub poena peccati,</hi> vpon penaltie of ſinning. And by ſo much the more grieuous ſhall the ſinne be, by how much the greater is the Office, and by how much the more the ſtipend is aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented. Now Kings (you will confeſſe vnto me) haue the greater office, and greater ſtipend in all things, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſhall they more grieuouſly ſinne, if they do not cumply therewith. And this is made good in the ſixth of Wiſedome, where in theſe very words it is expreſly ſaid: <hi>Potentes poten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter tormenta patientur;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Wiſd. 6.5, 6.</note> 
                  <hi>&amp; fortioribus fortior inſtat cruciatio:</hi> A ſharpe puniſhment ſhall be to them that be in high places;
<pb n="395" facs="tcp:180809:208"/>
and the mighty ſhall bee mightily tormented. The ſecond; That Fauourites are obliged, on paine of the ſaid penaltie, to ſerue their Kings in their owne perſons well and faithfully in thoſe buſineſſes, which they ſhall commit to their charge; and that in taking their pleaſure and eaſe, more then their Kings themſelues, and ſubſtituting others to performe that truſt and charge which is put vpon them, they cannot iuſtly enioy that authoritie, nor thoſe intereſts and profits which doe reſult from their priuacie. And let they themſelues tell me, what title they haue to enioy ſo much as they doe, when they take leſſe paines then their Kings, but pleaſure more? And to conclude with that which is here queſtioned in this Chapter, I ſay, That admitting Fauourites, to bee ſuch as they ought to be, it is fit notwithſtanding that there ſhould be more then one, or two. For thereby Kings ſhall haue the more helpe, and out of that emulation and zeale, which is wont to bee amongſt them, each of them will ſtriue to bee more conſiderate and better aduiſed in commanding others, and in begging and applying things to himſelfe, and his owne priuate profit, and more ſolicitous in doing ſeruice to the State, leſt others might get the ſtart of him in his Kings fauour. And howbeit the name of fauourite ſeemeth not to indure a companion, yet, if they fixe their eyes on that which they ought, which is the common good of the common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth, and the ſeruice of their Kings, it would neuer grieue them, that there ſhould bee others to aſſiſt for the ſame end and purpoſe; but like that great Fauourite and friend of God, <hi>Moſes,</hi> they would ſay, <hi>Vtinam omnes prophetar<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <seg rend="decorInit">S</seg>Vppoſing that that then which hath beene ſaid in the former Chapters, and that Kings are to haue ſuch perſons a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout them, who with proprietie may hold the name of friends (for ſuch qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie and condition muſt they be of, who poſſeſſe the boſome and ſoule of their Maſter by the communication of the greateſt and moſt ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret affaires) and performe the office of Fauourites; For, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though it be true, that it cannot properly be ſaid, that Kings haue friends, for that all (ſaue of their owne ranke) are infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour vnto them; yet is it likewiſe true, that the holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture (as we ſhewed you before) ſtiles Fauourites, friends. For the force of loue is of that great power, that it remoueth and lifteth vp things from their point and center, giuing the name of friend to a ſeruant and ſubiect. <hi>Qui diligit cordis munditiam,</hi>

                  <hi>propter gratiam labiorum ſuorum, habebit ami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cum Regem:</hi> He that loueth pureneſſe of heart, for the grace of his lippes, the King ſhall bee his friend. <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> doth admit betwixt the King and his ſubiect, a certaine kinde of friendſhip, howbeit the diſparitie and inequalitie bee very great, your Hiſtories doe celebrate the friendſhips of great Princes, held with their particular ſubiects. And thoſe which with other their equalls are called faithfull friends; with Kings, carry the name of Loyall-Subiects. Which (for that effect which wee pretend) importeth little this altering or changing of the name. That which moſt importeth and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueneth moſt, is, That we giue you ſome notice of thoſe qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities
<pb n="397" facs="tcp:180809:209"/>
which they ought to haue, and of thoſe ſignes, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by thoſe may be knowne, that are fitteſt and beſt for ſo great a Miniſtery.</p>
               <p>There are two qualities amongſt the reſt, which are pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſely neceſſarie in a Fauourite. And firſt I will ſet downe the firſt. Firſt of all then he muſt loue his King truly, and muſt not ſuffer himſelfe to be ouercome by couetouſneſſe, and his owne priuate intereſt. In the firſt particular, all doe agree with <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> and <hi>Plato.</hi> For no man can more faithfully giue counſell, then hee that loues his King more then his gifts. Which of all other is the moſt neceſſary to make one man truſt another, and to beleeue that which hee ſaith. For who will not credit that man whom he knowes loues him, and in all that he can, ſeekes to procure his good, without any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to his owne particular intereſt? He (ſaith Saint <hi>Gregory</hi>) that is fit to be a Fauourite, muſt haue a loue that is full, and diſ-intereſſed. <hi>Nullus fidelior tibi ad conſulendum eſſe poteſt,</hi>

Saint <hi>Iohn,</hi> in the Apocalypſe, ſets before vs (though ſomewhat darkly ſhadowed) a picture of good Fauourites
<pb n="398" facs="tcp:180809:210"/>
and Councellers. Which were certaine old men, clothed in white, wearing Crownes on their heads. To bee ſomewhat ancient, and well ſtricken in yeares, was a qualitie wont to be required in thoſe that were to aduiſe Kings, and giue them good counſell, in regard of their great experience and mature iudgement, which commonly accompanies ſuch kinde of men. And they are ſaid to be clothed in white, becauſe this colour ſignifies a pure heart, and a cleare conſcience, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with they ought to bee as it were apparrelled and adorned. How can he giue good counſell that is not clothed in white? That hath not <hi>Cor candidum,</hi> a white and vpright heart, pure and cleane from thoſe affections and paſſions that may ſmutt and ſullye it? And it is there likewiſe ſet downe, that euery one of them had like a King, a Crowne vpon his head. To giue vs thereby to vnderſtand, that hee that is to giue counſell vnto Kings, for the maintaining and vpholding of a kingdome, and to remedy what is therein amiſſe, may in ſome ſort conceit himſelfe to be a King; my meaning is, that he is to giue counſell, as if hee himſelfe were the King, and to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſe for him, as he would for himſelfe, were he in his place: And that hee is to giue his vote and opinion, as if the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome were his. And to be ſo free from expecting or reſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his owne particular intereſt, as if he were King himſelfe. Who neither expecteth nor pretendeth any merced, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, nor any addition of honour, or otherwiſe in his king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, for that hee hath already attained to the higheſt and ſupremeſt dignitie, which is the Crowne. In like manner, Kings Fauourites, and Counſellours ſhould liue as free from pretenſions, as if (hauing already got the Crowne) they had nothing more to pretend. Whoſe breaſt and boſome muſt be as white and as pure as whiteneſſe it ſelfe. And will be the better able to iudge betwixt white and blacke, right and wrong, by reaſon of their many yeares, and long expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience.</p>
               <p>This kinde of ſeruants and friends, which muſt be the life
<pb n="399" facs="tcp:180809:210"/>
and ſoule of their actions; let Kings bee very carefull how they make choice of them, and receiue them into fauour. For there is not any one thing, that doth ſo much manifeſt a Kings minde, as the election which he makes of his Fauou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rites and Councellours of State. For by them is his naturall inclination as well knowne, as in a workeman, by his manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factures, is diſcouered the Art and Trade whereunto hee is moſt inclined. And therefore I ſhall make bold to aduiſe Kings, that they make ſuch their Fauourites, that are men of worth, wiſe, prudent, diſ-intereſſed, and of a noble and gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous diſpoſition. For by their choice, men make iudgement of their King accordingly. And likewiſe when the Kings grace and fauour ſhall fall vpon good Subiects, his owne glory will be the greater. Let Kings (laying aſide all affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on) chooſe ſuch as are men of knowledge and experience, and that are powerfull in perſwading, and diſſwading. That know how to go in and out, with good ſatisfaction, amidſt thoſe ſo many, ſo diuers, and ſuch important buſineſſes, as daily offer themſelues; and to giue good, ſubtill, and graue anſwers, both by word of mouth, and by writing, to ſuch Ambaſſadours, and other great perſons, that ſhall come to treate and negociate with them. That haue ſeene and read much, and haue a generall knowledge in all things, but more particularly in the countries and Prouinces that are vnder their Kings command. That know what forces they are able to make, and to vnderſtand the ſtrength as well of their friends, as of their foes. Let them be of a franke and liberall minde. For this vertue the common people much loue and affect, and are wonderfully well ſatisfied therewith. And on the contrary, couetouſneſſe is much hated and abhorred by them. Let them (I ſay) bee bountifull, and deſirous to doe good to all in common, and to euery one in particular. In a word, let them be men well knowne to be faithfull and truſty, and ſuch as loue their Kings ſo well, as that they will preferre their authoritie and reputation before their owne, and ſtudie
<pb n="400" facs="tcp:180809:211"/>
and endeuour in all, and aboue all, what may make moſt for their good and aduantage. That they be wiſe, diſcreet, expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rienced, patient, without paſſion, diſintereſſed, and more zealous of the publike good, then of their priuate profit. For if they ſhall regard their owne intereſt and proper commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditie, they are neither good for the ſeruice of their Kings, nor for the gouernment of the commonwealth. For, in going about to meaſure out their priuacie by the yard of their par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular profit, they will make merchandiſe of all; and their doing good to others, ſhall bee for the benefiting of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues. Nothing comming vnder their hands, whereof (that they may not be accounted bad Cookes) they will not licke their owne fingers. The clingenſt and ſtrongeſt affection, is that of couetouſneſſe; it is like the headach, which hinder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the free vſe of mans faculties and ſenſes, not ſuffering him to doe any thing that is good. And though it bee true, that there are other vices, of greater offence to God, and more hurtfull to a mans neighbour, yet this hath I know not what miſchiefe in it, and more particularly in publike per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, which doth ſhew it ſelfe more openly then all the reſt, and doth breede, and nouriſh other ſinnes, as the roote doth the tree. <hi>Radix omnium malorum cupiditas; Quidam appetentes,</hi>

Vpon this foundation of couetouſneſſe, is built whatſoeuer tyrannicall imagination; and many through it, haue, and doe daily looſe the faith, and that loy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>altie which is due vnto God, and their Kings. <hi>Auri cupi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditas</hi>

(ſaith the ſame Saint) <hi>materia eſt perfidiae;</hi> The loue of gold is the cauſe of the loſſe of faith. When this pulls a Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uourite, it eaſily drawes him aſide, and carries him headlong to all theſe vices; for it is of more force then the Load-ſtone, and drawes him more after them, then that doth the iron; And is holpen on the more by the winde of vanitie and am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition. The Philoſopher <hi>Heraclitus</hi> ſaith, That thoſe that ſerue Vanity and Couetouſneſſe, ſuddenly depart from Truth and Iuſtice, and hold that onely for iuſt and moſt right, which is directed aright to their owne priuate intereſt. And this onely doe they make their aime, in all whatſoeuer they aduiſe their King; as was to be ſeene in that ſo often repeated caſe of King <hi>Aſſuerus,</hi> with his great Fauourite <hi>Aman,</hi> of whom hee demanded, what grace and fauour ſhould bee ſhowne to that Subiect, whom for his good ſeruices, hee de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired to honour. Whereupon, the winde of vaine-glory wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king in the head of him, and thinking this could be no man, but himſelfe, ſhewed himſelfe very magnificent and liberall in ordaining the honours and fauours, that were to be done vnto him. The vaine conceit of a couetous man, cuts out for himſelfe large thongs out of another mans leather. And when hee growes a little warme in the King his Maſters boſome (poore ſnake as hee was) with a falſe and feigned loue, hee goes hunting after his commoditie; and this failing, his loue alſo faileth. For his heart ſtretcheth it ſelfe no farther to loue, then what his hands can come to take hold on. <hi>Elpan comido, y la compania deſecha</hi> (ſaith the Prouerbe) No longer Cake, no longer company. Of ſuch friends, as theſe, the Prophet <hi>Michah</hi> bids vs beware. For no friend,<note place="margin">Micah 7.6. <hi>Ariſt. lib.</hi> 8. <hi>Ethic. cap.</hi> 4.</note> that ſeeketh his owne gaine, can euer (according vnto <hi>Ariſtotle</hi>) be faithfull and loyall to his King. Let Kings (I ſay) conſider once againe, and haue an eſpeciall care, that thoſe Fauourites, whom hee maketh choice of for his friends, be out of his owne proper election, and approued by his owne minde, and by the opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion and fame of their vertue, and not intertaining them at
<pb n="402" facs="tcp:180809:212"/>
any time by the ſole interceſſion of others, eſpecially ſuch as are great and powerfull, nor let them ſuffer themſelues to be carried away with the ſecret conſiderations of thoſe familiar and particular perſons which are about them, nor by the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſinuating and ſoothing perſwaſions of your flatterers and Sycophants; Who, as they are men, worke vpon diſcourſe, and corporall meanes, altogether framing them in order to their owne ends; Let them not giue beliefe and credit vnto them, but to the common fame and good report that goes of them; and thereon, let them place their eares and their vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding. For (as <hi>Tacitus</hi> ſaith) that is it which vſually makes the beſt choice. For it is not to bee doubted, but that concerning ſuch a ones vertues or goodneſſe, we ought ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to giue credit to the generall report, then to the voices of one or two. For one, may eaſily bee deceiued, and deceiue others by his tricks, and his particular intereſt; but neuer yet could one deceiue all; nor is it poſſible, that all ſhould in that their approbation, deceiue another. As for thoſe other ſeruants, which are to attend and waight vpon the Kings perſon, more for dignitie of place, and for outward appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence and oſtentation of greatneſſe, then for vſe and conue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niencie; which likewiſe in their kinde are very neceſſarie; let Kings a Gods name receiue them into their ſeruice, either vpon the interceſſion of others, or out of other particular re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects. For in this, there is little hazard, and may eaſily chop and change them, if they proue not good and fit for their turne. But in the choice of the former a great deale of care muſt be taken, for the chopping and changing of them is very dangerous, and vnleſſe there be very great cauſe for the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of it, it breeds an opinion of inconſtancie; which as it cannot but be hurtfull vnto all, ſo is it of great diſhonour vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Kings, much weakening their authoritie. But ſay there be iuſt cauſe of remouing them, why it is but as a Vomite; which howbeit it be true, that it remoueth the malignant hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour, and expells it from the ſtomacke, yet withall it carries
<pb n="403" facs="tcp:180809:212"/>
the good likewiſe away with it, and makes an end of that Subiect it works vpon, if it be too often vſed. For our horſes wee ſeeke bits and bridles, wherewith to make them to go well and handſomely, and if with thoſe they do not raigne, and carry themſelues according to our mind, we take others; and when we finde once that they are fitted as wee would haue them, we neuer chop nor change, but ſtill vſe the ſame. In like manner, it is not good to chop and change either Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uourites, or priuie Councellours too often, but to ſeeke out ſuch as are fit for their turne, and to carry ſuch a hand ouer them, as to bridle their inſolencie, and to reyne them in hard, if they finde them head-ſtrong. For being that they are thoſe horſes which guide the chariot of a Monarchie, if they bee not well bridled, of a gentle and tender mouth, and an eaſie reyne, they will play the iades, and breake both their owne neckes and their Maſters. In a word, euery King hath, or at leaſt repreſenteth two perſons, one publike, the other priuate. And therefore his actions ought likewiſe to be of two qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities. In thoſe that are particular, let them proceed therein as they will themſelues, according to their owne guſte and pleaſure; but in thoſe that are publike, as ſhall make moſt for the publike good. Hauing ſtill an eye to it's conſeruation and augmentation, and to the common approbation of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. And thoſe qualities, which formerly wee required in Councellers of State, wee here likewiſe conclude, that all of them are neceſſary for Fauourites. And if Kings peraduen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture (in regard of humane imperfection) cannot meete with men ſo perfect, let them bee as abſolute, as they can poſſibly light vpon; at leaſt, let them haue theſe two qualities, of loue, and an vnſpotted life; And let not Kings content themſelues that they haue them in a mediocritie, but in all perfection. For without theſe two, there are not any <hi>Statuae<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </hi> ſo vnpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable, as are ſuch men, being not good enough to be ſtaues, or to ſerue in the baſeſt and vileſt offices about a houſe, much more vnworthy to be Fauourites, and priuie Councellours.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="404" facs="tcp:180809:213"/>And becauſe the heart of man, which God hath hid out of ſight, to the end that he might reſerue it to bee the ſeate and manſion of his loue, is hard to bee knowne, and the thoughts thereof very ſecret and hid; for that by one and the ſame inſtruments, it worketh and expreſſeth it's conceits, be they falſe, or be they true, it is neceſſary that by ſome meanes the truth or deceit of it's words may be knowne, for to dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference thereby the true loue from the falſe. Amongſt other ſignes and coniectures whereof Kings may make vſe, for to know the minde of thoſe that are to hold ſo great and neare a place about their perſons, and to treate and communicate with them as it were the ſecrets of their ſoules; let them con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider and obſerue very well, in what kinde of manner they do proceed, and haue proceeded with thoſe with whom they haue formerly held friendſhip, and to whom they ſtand in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>debted and obliged for curteſies already done; if they ſhall ſee they carry themſelues well towards them, and performe all offices of true loue and friendſhip, then may they be indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to beleeue, that ſhewing themſelues louing and thankfull to others, they will be ſo towards them. And he that loueth not him, whom hee ought to loue, out of this or that other reſpect, will not loue his King, do he neuer ſo much for him. For this difference of more or leſſe altereth not the ſubſtance nor condition. The true loue of Fauourites (they being ſuch as they ought to be) conſiſteth (as we ſaid already) in louing their King diſ-intereſſedly, and to aduertiſe him of all that, which is fitting and conuenient for him, and that all, or the moſt deſire, that in their workes and actions for their greater perfection, there ſhould be credit and eſtimation; And laſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, of all that which (according to the more common opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on) requireth reformation and amendment (for onely the workes of the moſt high can be wholly inculpable) And of that which may in ſome ſort withdraw his Subiects loue from him, and aduiſing him thereof, worke ſo with him for to gratifie them in this or that publike benefit, whereby to
<pb n="405" facs="tcp:180809:213"/>
wedge the peoples loue the faſter vnto their Prince and So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueraigne. But falſe and feigned loue, that runnes a contrarie courſe; it alwayes hunts after it's owne commoditie, it com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendeth all, whatſoeuer his Prince doth; he excuſeth it in his preſence, and qualifies it for good, iuſt, and conuenient. Which being no other but a tricke of Court-cunning, and though they may well march vnder the ſtandard of vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowne enemies, yet are they eſteemed and rewarded as friends. And notwithſtanding all this, their Kings backe is no ſooner turned, but they murmure at him, or ſet others a worke to doe it for them; Complaining, that in regard of the naturall ill diſpoſition of Kings and great Princes cares (fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cile enough to heare ſmooth flatteries, but too harſh and hard to hearken to the truth) they dare not for their liues tell it him, nor aduenture to giue him the leaſt diſtaſte, though it concerne him neuer ſo neare, and that they plainly ſee, the not doing of it cannot but redound much to his hurt. And the true reaſon thereof is, for that the former, loue more the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of their Prince, then his fortune, and let him take it ill or well, all's one, they will treate truth, eſpecially in thoſe things that may concerne his ſafetie, or the good and quiet of his kingdome; and their good minde, true heart, and plaine-ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt meaning, make them bold to ſpeake, without fearing to offend, in that their good aduice, which they ſhall giue him. But this ſecond ſort of Fauourites loue not his perſon, but his fortune; And theſe, for their owne proper intereſt, and that they may not hazard their hopes, dare not ſpeake the truth, though they ſee the danger before their eyes: as per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons that would eaſily alter their faith and loyaltie, and take part with him whoſe ſword is ſtrongeſt, and therefore care not though their King fall, ſo as they may ſtand. And of ſuch, it may bee ſuſpected that they deſire a change, like thoſe which in gaming liue by <hi>Baratos,</hi> who for their owne benefit would haue fortune turne from the one to the other, their good wiſhes no longer following their firſt man, as not
<pb n="406" facs="tcp:180809:214"/>
hoping to haue any more from him, then what they haue already receiued; not caring to ſee them blowne vp, one after another, ſo as they may get by the bargaine. And moſt cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine it is, that thoſe who ſo much loue themſelues, and their owne proper intereſt, there is no truſting of them; for they haue no loue left either for their owne Lord and Maſter, or any body elſe. For ſuch baſe ſoules, and vngenerate ſpirits, drowned and ſwallowed vp in thoſe muddy materialls of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt, and Auarice, cannot loue any other thing with excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencie, and in a noble faſhion. And therefore it importeth much, that Fauourites bee diſ roabed, and ſtript quite and cleane of all that, which goes vnder the name of proper or ſelfe-loue, priuate intereſt, vſefull friendſhip, faction or kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred; and that they ſhould bee clothed with a wiſe and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creet kinde of goodneſſe, which nor knowes, nor can, nor will fauour ought, but vertue, and Iuſtice, and that which is good and honeſt. It is likewiſe ſpoken by way of Prouerbe, <hi>Quien ama à ſu Rey, ama à ſu grey:</hi> He that loues his King, loues his flocke. And he that is in the place of a Fauourite, and ſo neare about his Kings perſon, ought to bee as a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon father to all his Subiects, treating them as if they were his children, and procuring that not any one of them may depart diſcontented from his preſence, which would be the the onely Load-ſtone to draw all their loue and affection to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards him. So did that great Fauourite of the King of Syria, <hi>Naaman,</hi> whom all the people with a full and open mouth, called Father, correſponding with him in the loue of ſo many ſonnes, or children. For thoſe that are ſeated in ſo high a place, haue great cauſe, for many reaſons, to procure pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like loue; and, together with the grace of their Prince, to haue the good wills and affections of the people; for this, makes the other to be more durable and firme. For this is the naturall miſerie of great and powerfull perſons, that Enuie and Greatneſſe go alwayes hand in hand: the one ſtill accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panying the other. And there is not any poyſon like vnto it,
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:180809:214"/>
which moues and ſtirres vp ſuch violent pangs and paſſions in the ſtomacke, and more eſpecially if it worke vpon the priuacie and inwardneſſe of Fauourites with their Kings, as if that it ſelfe were not a true and ſufficient ſtrong poyſon. Seeing that it is held for certaine, that one word of a King, nay (which is more) one angry looke, or bended brow, hath ſent many a Fauourite to his graue. For (as <hi>Salomon</hi> ſaith) the life of the Subiect depends on the countenance of the King. And if we will not beleeue him, let vs ſee and obſerue how many Fauourites eſcape, which doe not dye of that wound, or the feare thereof; and more particularly with thoſe Kings which are of that condition (as one ſaid) that there is not two fingers breadth betweene their ſmile and their ſword; to the end that this their priuacie might bee had in the leſſe eſteeme. For your beſt Fauourites are but like your better ſort of fruits, which are ſooneſt ſubiect to be worme-eaten. For Enuie is a very worme, and hath the ſame quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties as a worme hath; and ſpreads it ſelfe ſo farre, that it ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends it ſelfe euen to thoſe that haue beene benefited by the Fauourite; the couetouſneſſe and riſentment of that which they doe not receiue, working more vpon them then the Law of thankfulneſſe, or of a gratefull acknowledgement for that, which they haue receiued. So that wee may ſay, That few are they who loue thoſe from whoſe hand they haue re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued ſome good, becauſe it was no greater. And thoſe that haue receiued none, that they are therein iniured, and wrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. So, that to qualifie and temper this inconuenience, it ſhall be wiſedome in Fauourites (and it will concerne them to vſe all the meanes they can deuiſe to effect it) to procure to bee wellbeloued. And no leſſe in Kings to ſeeke out ſuch as are modeſt, louing, affable, vertuous, honeſt, well beloued, and of a gratefull and thankfull diſpoſition.</p>

               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">F</seg>Or to reſolue this Queſtion, and to giue ſatisfaction to that which is here propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in this Chapter, it being a matter of ſo tender and dangerous a touch: I will firſt lay for my foundation, a true point of doctrine in naturall Philoſophie, cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brated with that ſentence of the glorious Saint <hi>Auſten; Amor meus, pondus me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um, illo feror, quocunque feror:</hi> The plummet which peaſeth man, and the wings wherewith the heart makes it's flight, is loue, which doth leade the dance to all the other paſſions of the ſoule. And as thoſe that ſaile in a deepe ſea, with full ſailes, runne on their courſe without any danger; but when they draw neare the ſhore, they take them downe and ruffle them that they may not runne their ſhip vpon ſome ſhelfe, or ſplit it ſelfe againſt ſome rocke; ſo likewiſe, when the heart is lift<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed vp vnto the loue of God, which is infinite goodneſſe, it may without perill plough the ſeas of this world, and with full ſayles cut the Maine, without danger of ſhelues, quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands, or rockes. For (according to that ſaying of the glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Saint <hi>Bernard</hi>) as the cauſe of our louing God, is God himſelfe: ſo, the meaſure of louing him, is to loue him with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out meaſure. <hi>Cauſa diligendi Deum, Deus eſt; modus dilectio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis, fine modo diligere.</hi> As the cauſe of our loue is infinite; ſo muſt it be without taxe or limitation, wherein there can be no exceſſe. But when the heart drawes but little water, and touches too cloſe vpon theſe things of the earth, which haue
<pb n="409" facs="tcp:180809:215"/>
their goodneſſe much limited, it will be high time, and very fit and conuenient, to ſtrike the ſayles of our loue, and to go on with a great deale of caution and conſideration, leſt this our veſſell ſhould ſticke in the ſands, neuer to bee gotten out againe, or fall vpon ſome rocke or other of vnaduiſedneſſe and indiſcretion. And this is ſo certaine a truth, that albeit the loue to our parents be ſo naturall, and obligatory, and ſo giuen vs in charge by God, with the promiſes of ſo many bleſſings on thoſe children which ſhall cumply with this loue, and with ſo many threatnings on thoſe that ſhall faile therein; yet notwithſtanding God himſelfe will, that therein there ſhould be a limitation and moderation.<note place="margin">Mat. 10.37.</note> 
                  <hi>Qui amat pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trem, aut matrem, plus quam me, non eſt me diguus:</hi> He that loueth father or mother more then me, is not worthy of me. And the common old Adage ſaith, That friendſhip muſt go no further then <hi>vſque ad aras,</hi> and ſtop there. And howbeit ſome would haue the limit, which is here put to loue, to be Death; I ſay, that it's limit, is Reaſon, and obedience to Gods Commandements. For when our Loue ſhall come to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter with them, it is to make a ſtand, and go no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
               <p>Our ſecond ground or foundation whereon we ſhall build, is this, That in Kings, next vnto the loue of God, and his Chriſtian Religion, no loue ought to be like vnto that, which they ought to beare vnto their kingdomes, and common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealths; for the end, for which Kings were firſt inſtituted and ordained, was the common good of their kingdomes. And as children haue a naturall obligation to loue their pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, becauſe from them, they haue receiued their natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall being; ſo Kings owe the like to their kingdomes and Commonwealths, becauſe next vnder God, they gaue them their being of Kings, and that power and authoritie, whereby they were to protect, defend, and augment them. Vpon theſe grounds and foundations muſt that loue and friendſhip be laid, which is to be held with Fauourites. Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
<pb n="410" facs="tcp:180809:216"/>
them, and giuing them power and authoritie, confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mable to that, which for this end ſhall be thought moſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenient.<note place="margin">Senec. lib. <hi>1.</hi> Epiſt. <hi>3.</hi>
                  </note> For albeit they (as <hi>Seneca</hi> ſaith) keepe the key of their Kings heart, and in matters of ſecreſie and benefits, are preferred before the reſt; yet this muſt be done with a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian kinde of prudence and diſcretion. Hauing euermore an eſpeciall care, that the force of his loue be not ſo violent, and ſo boundleſſe, that to giue content to one ſole Fauourite, hee diſcontent all the reſt of his Subiects; and to ſhew himſelfe faithfull and true vnto him, breake that faith and truth, which he owes vnto God, and his diuine Law. And that he proceed likewiſe therein with that freedome and libertie, that his Loue may not paſſe the bounds of reaſon, nor bee (like ſome ſhips that are runne on ground) ſo ſurely ſetled, that he cannot get off when hee will, and to turne that loue into ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred, and a full determination and reſolution of puniſhment, when the faults of a Fauourite ſhall deſerue his iuſt diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure <hi>Non habitabit in medio domus meae,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Pſal. 101.7.</note> 
                  <hi>qui facit ſuperbiam, &amp;c.</hi> Whoſo hath a proud looke, and an high ſtomacke, I will not ſuffer him. Mine eyes looke vnto ſuch, as be faithfull in the land, that they may dwell with mee. And whoſo lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth a godly life, he ſhall be my ſeruant; but there ſhall no deceitfull perſon dwell in my houſe. And he that telleth lies ſhall not tarry in my ſight. As likewiſe it is iuſt and meete, that on the contrary, hatred, puniſhment, and chaſtiſement, ſhould be turned into amitie, loue, and friendſhip, when the perſon hated, ſhall deſerue well. And this is the meaning of that ancient Prouerbe, <hi>Ama, tanquam oſurus &amp; odio habe, tanquam amaturus.</hi> The drift and ſcope of all which is this; That when wee ſhall place our loue and affection vpon hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane things, it be done with aduiſedneſſe, conſidering how ſubiect they are to change and alteration. So that, that which to day deſerues our loue, may to morrow deſerue our hate: And on the contrary, that which is diſliked and abhorred, may merit our loue, and good eſteeme. And we haue hereof a
<pb n="411" facs="tcp:180809:216"/>
very good example in the foreſaid King <hi>Aſſuerus,</hi> who ſo ſoone turned that loue which he bare vnto <hi>Haman,</hi> into that hatred, that hee cauſed him to be hanged vp; and <hi>Mar doche,</hi> that was condemned to the gallowes, he raiſed vnto honour, and put him into that place of priuacie and greatneſſe, which proud <hi>Haman</hi> ſo lately enioyed. Nor can Fauourites haue cauſe to complaine, if it be granted vnto them, that their pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uacie may reach ſo farre, that their Kings may loue them, as they do their owne royall perſons. But it is a doctrine recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued by all the Philoſophers, That the rule of that true friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip and loue, which one man beareth vnto another, is to be meaſured and conſidered by that which euery man beares vnto himſelfe. And that which equalls it ſelfe in this, is very perfect loue. <hi>Amicitiae lex preſcribitur, vt non minus,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Aug. lib. <hi>1.</hi> Soliloq. ca. <hi>3.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>nec plus quiſquam, amicum ſuum, quàm ſeipſum diligat.</hi> The Law of friendſhip is, that a man ſhould not loue his friend leſſe, or more, then himſelfe. <hi>Nemo</hi> (ſaith Saint <hi>Paul) animam ſuam odio habet, ſed nutrit, &amp; fouet eam:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Epheſ. 5.29.</note> No man euer yet hated his owne fleſh, but nouriſheth and cheriſheth it. And yet notwithſtanding this ſelfe-loue ought ſo to bee ordered by reaſon, that whenſoeuer it ſhall deſire any thing contrarie thereunto, it muſt ſharply be denyed it. <hi>Acriter reijciendus eſt</hi> (ſaith the learned Saint <hi>Chriſoſtome</hi>) In like manner, when Fauourites ſhall craue or deſire any thing contrary to reaſon, or the publike good of the commonwealth, they muſt bee denyed, what they demand, and Kings vpon thoſe occaſions muſt ſhew themſelues ſeuere and auſtere towards them. And this doctrine is ſo cleare and ſo plaine, that our Sauiour Chriſt left it for a patterne vnto Princes, in that anſwer of his which he gaue vnto his two kinſmen and Fauourites, <hi>Iohn</hi> and <hi>Iames,</hi> when hee told them; <hi>Neſcitis, quid petatis; Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtis bibere calicem? &amp;c.</hi> Ye know not what ye aske. Can ye drinke of the cup, &amp;c. <hi>Non eſt meum dare vobis, ſed quibus paratum eſt à Patre meo.</hi> To ſit on my right hand,<note place="margin">Mark. 20.37.</note> and on my left hand, is not mine to giue, but it ſhall bee giuen vnto
<pb n="412" facs="tcp:180809:217"/>
them, for whom it is prepared. And howbeit the words in this anſwer haue ſo many ſundry expoſitions, and diuers con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions, as the Interpreters vpon this place doe render; yet haue I noted three things therein, worthy the conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and of much conueniencie for Kings. In the firſt place, I obſerue the tartneſſe and ſharpneſſe of the anſwer, together with the ill-aduiſed and indiſcreete requeſt of thoſe two Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uourites, ſet downe in theſe three words: <hi>Neſcitis quid petatis:</hi> Ye know not what ye aske. And when Fauourites ſhall not weigh and conſider with themſelues, what, and how they aske; Let Kings bethinke themſelues, what, and how they giue. And let them not giue ſo much to one, as may giue oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion to all the reſt to murmure, and complaine. And let them likewiſe take into their conſideration, that the common condition of your Fauourites, is like vnto that of other par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular men, ſtill to deſire to better themſelues in their eſtate and degree. And therefore it ſhall bee a great point of wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, not to grant vnto them all that they ſhall aske; as here our Sauiour Chriſt aduiſeth Kings. Wotting well, that though they grant them their requeſt, yet are they not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented therewith, but rather take heart and courage vnto them to craue more and more, and with greater earneſtneſſe then they did before. For, Ambition and Couetouſneſſe are not ſatisfied, nor ſlackened with abundance, but are like vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to thoſe that are ſicke of the Dropſie, who the more they drinke, the more they thirſt. And beſides this heaping of honour vpon honour, and gift vpon gift, hath a greater dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger with it, in regard of thoſe perſons that receiue them. For moſt certaine it is, that the appetite of man is Hydropicall, which the more he drinketh, the more he thirſteth; and the more he getteth, the more he deſireth. And Princes may giue ſo much, that like Lucifer, they may come at laſt to couet and deſire that, which their Kings poſſeſſe. What an hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable creature was he, and of what ſingular parts, yet did he rebell againſt his Creator, out of Enuie and Pride, and onely
<pb n="413" facs="tcp:180809:217"/>
occaſioned through thoſe many graces and fauours which God had enriched him withall. And for that we are all of vs creatures, the like may be feared from vs; Being that we are not ſo incapable of this, as was that Angell of that which hee deſired. And it is fit, that wee ſhould leaue our ſelues ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to giue; for ordinarily we do all of vs deſire (a qualitie wherewith mans appetite is well acquainted) and which hath cauſed the greateſt and the fouleſt falls. For who is he, that would not (if he could) haue command, and be a King? And wee ought likewiſe to keepe ſomething in our hands to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtow, that we may not grow weary of ſeruing, being we can expect no further fauours, nor looke for any more rewards. For this alſo is very naturall, and a faſhion of ancient ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with moſt men, to waxe weary of ſtanding at a ſtay, not contenting themſelues to continue that grace, place, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, which they haue already acquired; but hold that for an affront, being now growne rich, which before they would haue taken for a great fauour, when they were poore. Thus doe we grow vnthankfull; and thus doe we grow forgetfull, being vainly carried away with the conceit of what we are. And we looſe the ſight of that low and meane eſtate, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in we were, by being raiſed to that highth and eminencie, wherein wee ſee our ſelues to bee ſeated. A naturall fault in mans eye-ſight, which knowes not how to looke downe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward; and as vnwilling to looke backward, but as much for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward as you will. But theſe forward birds, doe well deſerue to haue the waxe, wherewith their wings are faſtened, to be melted by that very Sunne, that gaue them their firſt warmth and light, and by their fall to be left an example to the world, to terrifie others. And in caſe, for ſome eſpeciall reſpect, Kings ſhall reſolue with themſelues, that all the beames of their greatneſſe ſhall illighten and giue life to one particular perſon, let the foundation of their fauours bee layed vpon thoſe qualities, deſarts, and ſeruices, which ought to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curre on thoſe perſons on whom they purpoſe thus to parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularize.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="414" facs="tcp:180809:218"/>Kings likewiſe are to conſider the Petitions of thoſe that ſue vnto them; which is my ſecond obſeruation, and taught by Chriſt himſelfe:<note place="margin">Mark. 10.38.</note> 
                  <hi>Poteſtis bibere calecem, quem ego bihiturus ſum?</hi> Can ye drinke of the cup that I drinke of? Iudging by himſelfe, in this demand which hee makes to theſe his Fauourites, who ſo raſhly and vnaduiſedly came vnto him to petition him for the two principall places, that for to poſſeſſe them, they ſhould haue all ſufficient and requiſite neceſſaries; vpon which point Chriſt examines them; and the like exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination ought Kings to make of thoſe qualities, ſpecified by vs, touching both Pretenders and Fauourites.</p>
               <p>The third thing which I recommend to your conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and which Chriſt teacheth Kings, is, the great caution and warineſſe which they are to vſe, in not being too facile, in granting all that their Fauourites ſhall require of them. Which is to bee gathered out of the laſt words of this his anſwer: <hi>Non eſt meum dare vobis:</hi> It is not mine to giue. Which, to my ſeeming, ſoundeth thus; It will not ſtand with my truth and iuſtice, to giue for kindreds-ſake, or other humane reſpects, that which my eternall Father hath pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared for thoſe which deſerue beſt. Kings ought to bee very circumſpect in promiſing, and not ouer eaſie in granting; for, if he ſhall be facile in granting what others ſhall deſire, hee may haue cauſe to repent himſelfe; and if he promiſeth, hee looſeth his liberty. A great gentleman of qualitie, whom King <hi>Philip</hi> the ſecond much fauoured for his worthy parts, and great abilities, talking one day with him, and walking a good while with his Maieſtie, after that hee had diſcourſed with him of diuers things, to the Kings ſo great good con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent and liking, that hee thought with himſelfe, that there was now a faire occaſion offered vnto him, to propound vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him (as he did) a buſineſſe of his owne. He told a friend of his, anon after that hee came from him, that is that very in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant he propoſed it, he caſt ſuch a ſtrange an dainſter<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> looke towards him, as if hee had neuer ſeene him before. Which
<pb n="415" facs="tcp:180809:218"/>
was no want of affection in the King towards him, for hee had had many ſufficient teſtimonie<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> thereof; but becauſe it was fitting for ſo wiſe and prudent a King to haue that cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſpection, leſt this his affection might miniſter occaſion vnto him to call his diſcretion in queſtion, in granting, or not granting that which either is not, or at leaſt ſhall ſeeme vnto him, not to be conuenient for him. For Kings muſt haue re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe to theſe two things; To haue a good and ſafe conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence with God, and intire authoritie, and good opinion with men. For with none doth that holy and prudent counſell of Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſuite more properly, then with them;<note place="margin">2. Cor. 8.21.</note> 
                  <hi>Prouidemus bona, non ſolum coram Deo, ſed etiam coram hominibus:</hi> Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiding for honeſt things, not onely in the ſight of the Lord, but in the ſight of men. Which cannot be, when as Fauou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rites either doe all what they liſt of themſelues, or get their Kings to doe it for them. When the Senſitiue appetite ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecteth whatſoeuer it affecteth, the vnderſtanding (which is the ſoules king) remaines oppreſſed and diſgraced, and with that foule note, which the kingly Prophet <hi>Dauid</hi> giues it; <hi>Homo, cum in honore eſſet, non intellexit,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Pſal. 49.12.</note>

And therefore when Kings out of their particular affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, or for the auoiding of trouble, and the fulier inioying of their caſe and pleaſure, ſhall giue abſolute power to their Fauourites to doe and vndoe, as they pleaſe, preſently one blot or other (which they will hardly euer get out) will bee laid vpon their royall perſons. Nor need wee herd to relate the hurt which comes thereby, and the occaſion which it giues vnto the Subiects, neither to thinke nor ſpeake of their Princes with that reſpect which is fitting; eſpecially when the Fauourites are none of thoſe which helpe to beare the weight and burthen of buſineſſes, but ſhake them off from their owne ſhoulders, and lay them vpon other that are fitted to their hand, and of whom they reſt well aſſured, that they
<pb n="416" facs="tcp:180809:219"/>
will doe nothing but what they will haue them to doe, wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king their will and pleaſure in all that they are able. And this is not that which Kings and Common wealths need: but it much importeth, that their Fauourites ſhould bee of that good and quicke diſpatch in buſineſſes, that all the people might loue them for it; for from the contrary great inconue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niences are wont to ariſe. When the <hi>Shechemites</hi> were ſo vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mannerly and vnciuill in their language againſt their King <hi>Abimilech,</hi> amongſt other things which they vttered and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged againſt him, they ſaid this in ſcorne of him; <hi>Nunquid non eſt filius Ierobael,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Iud 9 28.</note>

For they may, for their pleaſure, or their profit, ſubſtitute other their Fauourites, and oblige the people, that they either negociate with, or buy out their negociation of them.

For the people ſeeing their King ſo led by the noſe, as it were, and to yeeld to all that he would haue him doe, were verily perſwaded that he was bewitch't; for he had ſuch power ouer the will &amp; vnderſtanding of the King, that he neither vnderſtood what he gaue, not knew not how, or at leaſt had not the face to
<pb n="417" facs="tcp:180809:219"/>
deny him any thing, that hee was willing either to aske, or take; whilſt like the vnthankfull yuie, he went ſucking away all the iuyce and ſappe of the tree, all that good Kings wealth and ſubſtance, his being, his authoritie, and little leſſe then his kingdome. And loſt by this meanes ſo much of his au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie, that ſome of the <hi>Grandes</hi> of the kingdome, and the <hi>Infantes,</hi> his brethren, and the Kings of Aragon, and Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uarre, betooke them to their Armes, and made warre againſt him; he ſeeing himſelfe vpon ſome occaſions diſobeyed by his ſonne and Prince, and forſaken of his wife and Queene. Whereupon grew many ciuill broyles, and all vnder the title and pretext of recouering their libertie, and of pulling their neckes from vnder the yoke of that ſlauery and ſubiection wherein they were, rendering that reaſon in their excuſe, which all the whole kingdome could but take notice of, That all buſineſſes paſt through his Fauourites hands, and that the King did not negociate in his owne perſon. The proſecution whereof I remit to thoſe Hiſtories that make mention there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of. And it cannot bee denyed, that this Fauourite notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding had many good things in him, that might very well deſerue his Kings loue; for he had ſerued him valiantly in great and vrgent occaſions, and had put his perſon and life in perill for his ſake. But as his priuacie and fauour went increaſing, ſo with it increaſed his ambition and couetouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and that in that high degree, that he grew hatefull to the whole kingdome; and in the end no leſſe odious to the King himſelfe: who comming at length vnto himſelfe, fell into the account of thoſe damages and loſſes, which he had receiued in his kingdome, both in his reputation and autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie, by putting the reines wholly into his hands, taking thereby too much libertie to himſelfe, and ruling the State as he liſted. The <hi>Grandes</hi> repreſented to his Maieſtie the abuſes that inſued thereupon, as the ingroſſing of the greater Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and ſelling of the leſſer, and ouerſwaying the Courts of Iuſtice; And vſing many other effectuall perſwaſions, groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
<pb n="418" facs="tcp:180809:220"/>
vpon other iuſt complaints, propoſing for remedie and redreſſe thereof, the intereſt &amp; profit that might accrew vnto him, by calling him to account, and that he might thereby get into his hands an infinite deale of treaſure; the King liked very well of their propoſitions, and admitting their reaſons, he fell off from his Fauourite, waging warre againſt him with his owne money, wherewith hee thought, if neede ſhould ſerue, to ſuſtaine and vphold himſelfe. This ſlippery footing haue all thoſe things which haue not their hold-faſt in God. For they turne to the hurt of thoſe that put their truſt in them. And it is his mercie to mankinde, that they ſhould pay for it in this life, howſoeuer they ſpeed in the life to come; which we will leaue to Gods iuſtice, and the ſtrict account that will be taken of them. In concluſion, this great Fauou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite dyed, being fallen from his priuacie with his Prince, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priued of all that wealth and treaſure which he had ſo gree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily ſcraped together, ending his life with a great deale of ſorrow and diſcontent, and to the great reioycing of his op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſites. Though this did not ſerue for a warning to thoſe that came after him, but without feare of the like terrible and deſperate falls, they ranne themſelues out of breath in the purſuite of the like priuacie.<note place="margin">Ioh. 3.29.</note> Saint <hi>Iohn Baptiſt</hi> (we know) was Chriſts great Fauourite; and the Goſpell ſtiles him to be <hi>Amicus Sponſi,</hi> the friend of the Bridegroome. But his great goodneſſe and holineſſe of life did the more gloriouſly ſhew it ſelfe in this, that by how much the more Chriſt did in-greaten and authorize him, by ſo much the more did hee leſſen and humiliate himſelfe; and laboured by all poſſible meanes, by diminiſhing his owne, to increaſe the authoritie and credit of his Lord and Maſter, ſaying, <hi>Illum oportet creſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ioh. 3.30.</note> 
                  <hi>me autem minui:</hi> He muſt increaſe, but I muſt decreaſe: And this is that glaſſe wherein the Fauourites of Kings are to looke; taking into their conſideration, that by how much the more they ſeeke to greaten themſelues, in making oſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of their power and authoritie; by ſo much the more
<pb n="419" facs="tcp:180809:220"/>
they leſſen and diſ-authoriſe that of their Kings, with whom, is ſo dangerous any whatſoeuer ſhew, or ſhadow, of equali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, or competition, that euen in the higheſt top of priuacie, the more certaine, and leſſe reparable, vſually, is the fall. How iocond, and how well contented went <hi>Haman</hi> out of the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace, when Queene <hi>Eſther</hi> inuited him to dine with the King and her ſelfe. When loe, the very next day after they draggd him from that banquet and royall Table to the gallowes. And therefore let no man truſt or relye on the fauour of Kings, be he neuer ſo rich, or neuer ſo fortunate; for in them it is ordinarily ſeene, that all theſe faire ſhewes are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly conuerted into manifeſt demonſtrations of hatred.</p>
               <p>Out of all this that hitherto hath beene ſaid, let Fauou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rites make vnto themſelues this vſe and inſtruction, to know the danger and ſlipperineſſe of the place wherein they ſtand, euen then when they finde themſelues moſt of all inthroni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed. For moſt true is that ſaying, of, <hi>Fulmen petit culmen;</hi> The higheſt Towers, and the higheſt hills are moſt of all ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect to <hi>Iones</hi> thunder-bolts, and lightning. And let Kings likewiſe take this into their conſideration by way of aduice, That when they ſhall haue found their Fauourites to be fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed with thoſe qualities before ſpecified, and that they are ſuch, that thereby they may merit their grace and fauour, and ſo great, both place and part in their heart, it ſtands with very good reaſon, that they ſhou d bee honoured by them with particular mercedes and fauours, becauſe they helpe them to beare the burthen of their cares, and are expoſed to great dangers, and greater enuyings; as it happened to that great Fauourite of the King of Perſia, whom the Princes of his kingdome did pretend to remoue from the Kings elbow, and to put him in the denne amidſt the Lions, that by them hee might be there rent in peeces. Whereof, no other cauſe could be found againſt him, but his Kings fauour, bearing enuie to his priuacie (that common Moath to high places) from which none, be he neuer ſo good, neuer ſo honeſt, can eſcape. For,
<pb n="420" facs="tcp:180809:221"/>
it is very naturall in men to riſent, that hee ſhould out-ſtrip them, who but yeſterday was their fellow and companion. They hold that honour for an iniurie, that is done to their equall, and thinke themſelues go backward, and looſe of their authoritie and reputation, if another bee preferred before them. Which is ſuch an offence, that God preſently takes notice of it, and paſſeth it not ouer without puniſhment. For this priuacie with Kings is a thing of his diſpoſing, and for ſuch ends as hee pretends; and there is not any Subiect, that riſes to ſuch great place, but that he muſt paſſe through the weights and ballance of his diuine prouidence, who chooſeth theſe, and refuſeth thoſe, vſing them as meanes to worke his ſecretends.<note place="margin">Prou. 29.26.</note> Many (ſaith <hi>Salomon</hi>) ſeeke the Rulers fauour, but euery mans iudgement commeth from the Lord. The election comes from God, it is not ſo much the King, that chooſeth them, as God, who moues his heart thereunto. And if he do vphold them with his powerfull hand, in vaine is it for others to go about to trippe vp their heeles. For (as Saint <hi>Cyprian</hi> ſaith) <hi>Calamitas ſine remedio eſt,</hi>

                  <hi>CHAP. XXXVI.</hi> Whether the Kinsfolke and friends of Fauourites are to be excluded from Offices.</head>
               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>His place requireth that we auerre that, which amongſt diſcreet perſons, and ſuch as are zealous of the common good, is vſually called in queſtion, and made a doubt: To wit, whether or no, it be inconuenient, that the Kinsfolke, friends, and followers of Kings Fauou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rites ſhould bee put into places of Office and Gouernment? For, it cannot but ſeeme an vnreaſonable thing, that thoſe who haue ſuch parts and qualities as well deſerue to bee em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed in ſuch places of charge and command, ſhould there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore onely and <hi>eo nomine,</hi> bee excluded from them, for that they haue alliance and friendſhip with the ſaid Fauourites. Being that this, in it ſelfe, is not ill. Beſides the loue and affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction which Kings beare vnto their Fauourites, cannot (like your bad-made-clothes) ſo ſhrinke vpon themſelues, or be ſo ſtraight-laced, that it ſhall not likewiſe extend it ſelfe to the friends and allyes of thoſe, to whom they profeſſe ſo much loue. Againe, a good, if not a greater part of theſe mens happineſſe and content, conſiſteth in being able to do good, and to raiſe their friends.</p>
               <p>But for the better ſatisfying of this doubt, it is fit that we ſhould firſt conſider and diſtinguiſh of the qualitie of the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of this Alliance and friendſhip with thoſe Fauourites, as alſo of the condition and qualitie of thoſe offices. For in your offices there are ſome of grace, and ſome of Iuſtice. In the diſtribution of the former, we are to looke no further then to grace, and the Kings good will and pleaſure. In the latter
<pb n="422" facs="tcp:180809:222"/>
to that diſtribution which is agreeable to diſtributiue Iuſtice. There is likewiſe a great difference in the perſons. For ſome are of better qualities and deſarts, then other ſome. And theſe are in all prouiſions that are made to be firſt preferred, be they, or be they not, of kinne and acquaintance with the Fauourites. And there are many good reaſons that make for their part. Others there are, that are inferiour in merit, and the foreſaid qualities; and theſe in no wiſe, may or ought to be preferred for the kindred or friendſhip which they hold with Fauourites. For it were a ſinne of accepting of perſons, which is contrary to diſtributiue Iuſtice. Others there are, that are euery way equall with the reſt of the pretenders; and on this Hinge, hangs the force of the Queſtion. Now if they ſhall ſtand in this equalitie, and vpon theſe equall tearmes with the reſt, in thoſe qualities that are fitting for Office, it ſeemeth that they ſhould receiue ſome wrong, in being exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded without any fault of theirs; For it is no fault, to bee the friend or kinſman of a Fauourite. To this doubt, the anſwer would be made the more difficult, if your Fauourites through their too much ambition and couetouſneſſe had not taught vs the great inconueniences which reſult in a Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth, by opening this doore vnto them, and conferring the ſaid Offices on their friends and Allyes, vnder colour and pretext that they are as well deſeruing as others. Firſt of all, for that Kings, as Shepherds and common parents of the whole Commonwealth, are to make a diſtribution of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours, and of wealth, equally reparting and diuiding them, in that indifferent manner, that they may reach to all houſes and families, or at leaſt to extend them as farre as they are able. Like a good Husbandman, who, that hee may haue a good and plentifull crop, throwes and ſcatters his ſeed on this ſide, and that ſide, and euery where. Secondly, for that it is a very odious thing, and which breedeth bad bloud, and ingendreth ill humours in thoſe who onely in regard of this their kindred and friendſhip, ſee themſelues depriued and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>debarred
<pb n="423" facs="tcp:180809:222"/>
of that, which they might otherwiſe challenge by deſert. And others on the other ſide, when they ſee that they can neither come to be kinſmen, nor friends, nor of familiar acquaintance with Fauourites (which are the references that muſt preferre them) the firſt nature hauing denyed it them; the other their bad fortune, or the Fauourites diſaffection, ſeeing themſelues hopeleſſe of all helpe and remedie, either they runne themſelues headlong into ſome deſperate at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt, or at leaſt fall to flagge in their vertue; either of which cannot chooſe but bee of great inconuenience to the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth. Thirdly, for that it is not fitting, that Fauou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rites ſhould come to be very powerfull, either in their owne proper wealth and ſubſtance, or in the greatnes and ſtrength of their friends and Allies. For the more they increaſe in theſe, the more doe their Kings decreaſe; and ſometimes it hath beene ſeene to grow to that exceſſe, that powerfull Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces haue ſeene, or at leaſt imagined themſelues to be of leſſer power then they could haue wiſht it, or had beene need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to haue repreſſed, and cut ſhort the ambitious wings, and high flowne inſolencies of their Fauourites. Fourthly, for that vnder this colour, occaſion might bee giuen to Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uourites to diſpoſe in ſuch ſort of the gouernment of king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes, that Kings ſhould not come to the knowledge of ought that paſſeth in them, be it good or bad, more then ſhall ſtand with the good liking of their Fauourites, and make moſt for their owne ends. So that, neither thoſe that are wronged, ſhall finde meanes to bee righted; nor thoſe that are zealous of the common good, and of their Kings autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie and reputation, be admitted to aduertiſe and giue notice vnto him, of that which doth moſt concerne him. For Kings, by reaſon of their retiredneſſe, cannot come to the full know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of all that paſſeth. One of the things wherewith they charged that great Fauourite of King <hi>Don Iuan,</hi> in that ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence which they pronounced againſt him, was, That hee had put into the offices of the Kings houſe, and without his
<pb n="424" facs="tcp:180809:223"/>
houſe, and in places of gouernment, perſons that were tyed and wedged to his houſe, either by fee-tayle, or by friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip. I referre my ſelfe to that, which the ſentence ſaith, ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king in the perſon of King <hi>Don Iuan</hi> the ſecond. And it is not to be doubted, that when Fauourites ſhall wholly apply themſelues to ſeaze vpon all the Ports, thereby to know all, and ſo to ſtoppe vp all the doores and paſſages, that none can come to negociate with their Kings, but by their hands, it is no other but a binding of their Kings hands, and to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe them with a palliated and cloaked kinde of tyranny, with relation to their priuate Intereſt. And becauſe from our very firſt entrance into this our diſcourſe, our purpoſe was to confirme whatſoeuer we propoſed, by the teſtimonies of holy Scripture, to the end that no man vpon any falſe preſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſall, ſhould ſo much as ſurmiſe, or thinke, that we go about to tread too neare vpon the heeles of Fauourites, I will likewiſe remit my ſelfe in this particular, to that Letter regiſtred in the Scripture, which that great King <hi>Artaxerxes</hi> wrote to all the Dukes and Princes, and to all his vaſſalls of 127. Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uinces of his kingdomes, wherein with indeared reaſon hee propoundeth the inſolencies and tyrannies, exerciſed by Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uourites, who vſing amiſſe the fauours and mercedes, which their Kings doe them, ſeeke to all things before them, with a high hand. And for that the holy Ghoſt would haue all this ſet down in the ſacred Hiſtory, we may here very well interſert ſome part thereof, which is well worthy the noting, <hi>Multi,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Eſther 16.2.</note> 
                  <hi>bonitate principum, &amp; honore, &amp;c.</hi> Many, the more often they are honoured with the great bounty of their gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Princes, the more proud they are waxen; And indea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour to hurt not our Subiects onely, but not being able to beare abundance, doe take in hand to practiſe alſo againſt thoſe that doe them good. And take not onely thankfulneſſe from among men, but alſo lifted vp with the glorious words of lewd perſons that were neuer good, they thinke to eſcape the iuſtice of God, that ſeeth all things, and hateth euill. Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentimes
<pb n="425" facs="tcp:180809:223"/>
alſo, the faire ſpeech of our friends put in truſt to mannage the affaires, haue cauſed many that are in authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie to bee partakers of innocent bloud, and hath inwrapped them in remedileſſe calamities. Beguiling with the falſehood and deceit of their lewd diſpoſition, the innocencie and good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of Princes, &amp;c. And it oftentimes commeth to paſſe, that the good actions and intentions of Kings are hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, and the light of their Iuſtice eclipſed, by the interpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition of ſome terreſtriall bodie, which doth darken the glory thereof, as the interuention of the earth, obſcureth the Sunne. And the publike misfortunes which befall the common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth, and the particular wrongs and iniuſtices, which men by this meanes muſt indure, euen vnder the raigne of a iuſt and religious King, make his Empire hatefull; for it is a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall property incident to the vulgar, when any misfortune ſhall befall a State, to remoue the blame from themſelues, and to lay the fault vpon thoſe that are of greater ranke and qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity. But to returne to our intended purpoſe, I ſay, That in the Offices of Iuſtice (I meane) wherein diſtributiue Iuſtice requireth conſideration of merit, way is not to bee giuen to the friends and kinsfolke of Fauourites, but reſpect rather to bee had to the common good, wherein is to bee vſed the fore-ſpecified warineſſe and circumſpection. And in ſuch ſort may the riſentment and complaints of the kingdome in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe, that howbeit the ſaid friends and kinſmen, ſhould in their abilities haue the aduantage of others, yet ought they to be excluded. For this reaſon, in point of weale publike, is of more weight and conſequence, then any ſufficiencie what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer in thoſe other pretenders. Marry, in thoſe other offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces which we call Offices of grace, (for that they neither haue the adminiſtration of Iuſtice, nor gouernment, the hand may be ſtretched out in a freer manner vnto thoſe that haue any reference of amitie or alliance vnto Fauourites. But theſe offices are but few, and of no great importance; and in caſe an exact conſideration ſhould bee had, there being not
<pb n="426" facs="tcp:180809:224"/>
that office, bee it neuer ſo ſmall, wherein a man ſhall not meete with ſome oppoſites and pretenders, wee muſt not be too haſty, but hold the hand awhile, that fitting prouiſion might be made according to the qualities and merits of the perſon. One, that was a principall Councellour of State, cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified a certaine graue and worthy perſon, that he being <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>calde de Corte,</hi> the common hangmans office fell voide, and that hee was ſo earneſtly ſued vnto, and ſuch interceſſions therein vſed, that he was faigne to make two, the better to cumply with his owne obligation, and their importunitie. And of the Catholicke Queene <hi>Donna Iſabel,</hi> it is ſaid, That when ſhe gouerned the State, together with King <hi>Don Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nando,</hi> her husband, there fell by chance a paper from forth her ſleeue, wherein ſhee had written with her owne hand; Let the Cryars place of ſuch a Citie be beſtowed vpon ſuch a one, for that he hath the beſt voice. And if in ſo meane an office, theſe Catholicke and prudent Princes had ſuch great care and reſpect to the qualities of the perſons; what care ought there to bee had in thoſe of Iuſtice and gouernment? What in Eccleſiaſticall dignities, which are the pillars of our ſacred Religion? When the day of that ſtrict and rigorous ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count ſhall come, which God ſhall require at their hands, they will then ſee how much this did import them.</p>
               <p>Let then the finall reſolution of this queſtion be, That ſuppoſing that the naturall inclination of Fauourites, is to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit all, and that thoſe that are neareſt vnto them, for what reſpect ſoeuer it be, are to bee preferred vnto Honours and Offices, I will not ſtraighten them ſo much, nor my words, and counſell, and ſeeme to be too much republike, and intire, in condemning all their actions; for that it hath been a thing alwayes permitted to thoſe that are put in ſuch high places. But I would not haue it paſſe for a rule, in the prouiſion of publike offices, through which haue paſt ſuch perſons as well vnderſtood what belonged to State affaires, and the conſeruation of Kings, and their kingdomes, and that were
<pb n="427" facs="tcp:180809:224"/>
complete in all kinde of good learning and knowledge; who witting, that thoſe, who had power with their Kings, would fauour thoſe that were theirs, out of that inclination which is common to all men, haue not ſtickt to ſay, that this may be done, but with this conſideration, that it bee not to the hurt of the commonwealth. For there is not that ground, plant, or man, ſo barren, but hath ſome vertue in it, and is good for ſome Miniſtrie or other. In confirmation whereof, wee are likewiſe to conſider, that in naturall things, there is not any ſo vile, and ſo baſe, which alwayes, and at all times is vnprofitable. And there are ſome caſes, wherein Experience hath taught the profit, that may be taken therefro, for the vſe and conſeruation of mans life. And on the other ſide, there is nothing ſo precious, ſo eſtimable, and ſo wholſome, which is alwayes, and at all times, profitable. For there are ſome, as alſo ſome infirmities, which would proue mortall, ſhould they bee applyed vnto them. And therefore mans prudence doth come to conſiſt in this, to know it's qualitie, and to vnderſtand aright the eſtate and complexion of the man, and according thereunto to make vſe thereof, and of it's vertue. And therefore hee that hath (by his Kings fauour) the ſupreme diſpoſall of all, let him conſider and know, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by himſelfe, or by others that are his confident friends, (being as free, as free may bee, from naturall affections) the diſpoſitions and inclinations of men, and together with this, the qualitie of the offices, and perſons, which are to gouerne, and bee gouerned; and let him imply euery one in that, for which hee ſhall bee found fit and good. And keeping this courſe, he ſhall cumply with his owne inclination, and natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall deſires. And ſhall therein do his King and countrey good ſeruice. But for a concluſion and vpſhot of all that is paſt, let thoſe aduertiſements ſerue, which follow in the ſubſequent Chapter.</p>

               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>LL thoſe that write of the qualities of a good Prince, doe agree in this, that he ought to haue his will free, independent, ſubiect onely to God, and his diuine Law; without ſubiecting, or ſubmitting it to any other loue. For it booteth little, that he be Lord of many kingdomes, if he be a ſlaue to that which hee extremely loueth. That he ought to bee of a good courage, and of a ſound and ſetled iungement, not ſuffering a ſuperiour, or equall in his gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: For (as wee ſaid in the beginning of this Diſcourſe) kingdomes are by ſo much the more ſuſtained, and augmen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, by how much the more neare they approach to the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernment of one. Whereas on the contrary, they runne much hazard, when the reynes of the Empire are diuided, and put into ſeuerall hands. The Romanes neuer enioyed ſo much peace and plenty, as after that <hi>Auguſtus Caeſar</hi> was declared ſole Lord of the Empire, without dependance on any other. Which aduiſe (amongſt many other good in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions) the Emperour <hi>Charles</hi> the fifth gaue likewiſe vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the King his Sonne, to wit, That he ſhould be a very pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe louer of Truth; That hee ſhould not giue himſelfe ouer vnto Idleneſſe; And that he ſhould alwayes ſhew himſelfe a free and independant King; not onely in apparence, but in ſubſtance. For it is very proper vnto Kings to rule, not to be ruled. And to adminiſter their kingdomes themſelues by their owne will, and not by anothers. For he will not be ſaid
<pb n="429" facs="tcp:180809:225"/>
to be a King, who being to command, and correct all, ſhould eaſily ſuffer himſelfe to be led away, and gouerned by others. And therefore it is fit, that hee ſhould alwayes ſtand vpon his owne bottome, and in none of his actions expreſſe him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe to depend on the aide and opinion of others. For this were to acknowledge a Superiour, or a Companion in go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernment, and to diſcouer his owne weakneſſe. <hi>Infirma enim eſt potentia</hi> (ſaith <hi>Patritius) quae alienis viribus nititur:</hi>

                  </note> That's but a poore power, that muſt bee vnder-propt by the ſtrength of others. In ſtead whereof, I would haue him to ſit in Councell, and to treate and communicate buſineſſes with ſuch perſons to whom it appertaineth, as heretofore I ſaid. Saying onely now, That that King is in a miſerable and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentable caſe, that muſt depend on anothers helpe. Vpon a certaine occaſion, <hi>Alexander</hi> the Great ſaid; <hi>Se malle mori, quam regnare rogando:</hi> That he had rather die, then raigne by ſupplicating and intreating. And no otherwiſe doth that King raigne, who ſhewes himſelfe a Coward, and ſuffers the excellencie of his courage to bee ouerwhelmed and carried away with the current of hard and difficult things, which many times offer themſelues, leauing the reſolution of all to the mercie and fauour of others, by whoſe helping hand it ſeemeth that he liueth and raigneth. This (ſaid the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour <hi>Veſpaſian</hi>) is to dye ſtanding. And as that King is dead, which leaues that to another which hee can doe him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, and which doth properly appertaine vnto his office; and as he ſhall not truly cumply with his obligation, if he ſhould go about to draw ſolely to himſelfe the gouernment of his whole kingdome; much leſſe in like manner ſhall he cumply therewith, if hee ſhould caſt off all care from himſelfe, and relye wholly vpon others. For Extreames, in all things, are ill. And an extreme thing it were, that hee ſhould take vpon himſelfe the whole weight and burthen of buſineſſes, and to haue all things paſſe through his owne hands; it being likewiſe no leſſe, if he ſhould ſhift off all from
<pb n="430" facs="tcp:180809:226"/>
his owne ſhoulders, and put his hand to nothing, as did <hi>Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tellius,</hi> and <hi>Iouinianus,</hi> who did in ſuch ſort diſ-loade them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues of their offices, and ridde their hands of all matter of gouernment, that all was ordered and gouerned by other mens arbitrement, and none of theirs. Of the former it is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported, that he forgot that hee was Emperour. And of the other, that hee intended nothing but eating and drinking, gaming and whoring. So that both of them came to ſuch miſerable ends, as their retchleſſe and careleſſe kinde of liuing had deſerued. <hi>Childericke,</hi> King of France, and third of that name, is (and not without iuſt cauſe) condemned by the writers of thoſe times, for that hee did wholly quit him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe of buſineſſes, and led ſo idle and vnprofitable a life, that he tooke care of nothing, recommending all to his great Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uourite <hi>Pipine,</hi> who did rule and gouerne him as hee liſted. And there was not any meeting or conuerſation through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the kingdome, wherein men did not mutter and mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mure at it. For their nimble and actiue nature could by no meanes indure, that their King ſhould be but the ſhadow of a King, and ſtand for a Cypher, ſheltering himſelfe vnder the ſhade of another. Which could not chooſe (conſidering how vſuall a thing it is) but put ſpirit into <hi>Pipine,</hi> and adde met<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall to his power. For it is very proper to the condition of men, the more high they are in place and dignitie, to deſire the more honour, and the more wealth. There are but few of your great and powerfull perſons, which are not hydro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picall, and doe not thirſt after new honours, and new ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uancements; And ſome haue proceeded ſo farre in their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſions, that they haue preſumed (as this Fauourite did) to quit the King of his Crowne. Willingly hearkening vnto thoſe flatterers about him, which did whiſper this in his eare, and egge him on vnto it. It likewiſe began to bee treated of amongſt the great Lords of that kingdome, How much bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter command and rule were in one Head, then in two: And how that all kingdomes had euermore a deſire to haue but
<pb n="431" facs="tcp:180809:226"/>
one Prince; And that all prudent and wiſe men, haue (in reaſon of State) held this gouernment to be the beſt and ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt; and that it was not fit, that the vniforme body of a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth, or kingdome, ſhould bee ſubiect and obedient to two Heads: To wit, that one ſhould enioy the name and title of King, and the other poſſeſſe the power. And that it were better that all ſhould obey one, that had wiſedome and experience, and that had beene bred vp in buſineſſes, and the mannaging of State-affaires, whereby to gouerne them in peace and Iuſtice. And ſithence, that in <hi>Pipine</hi> theſe qualities did concurre, and that on him all the buſineſſes of impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance did depend, it were good that hee ſhould bee their King, and that <hi>Childericke</hi> ſhould take his eaſe and pleaſure. Hereupon they treated with <hi>Pipine,</hi> who though hee gaue eare vnto what they ſaid, yet would not raſhly aduenture himſelfe to accept of the Crowne, vnleſſe Pope <hi>Zacharias</hi> might firſt be conſulted therein. Whereupon they ſent their Embaſſadours, who had inſtruction to render ſuch reaſons to the Pope, that might moue him to approue thereof, and iudging <hi>Childericke</hi> to bee vnfit for the gouernment, might abſolue the French of their oath which they had taken, and that obedience which they ought to their King, and that he ſhould depriue him of the kingdome, and further declare, That ſince <hi>Pipine</hi> did rule and command all, and had ſo many good indowments, that hee might likewiſe be inueſted with the title of King. And the Archbiſhop of <hi>Maguncia</hi> was the man, that was nominated to ſet the Crowne on his head, and to declare him to bee King of all France. Being thus back't, they ſummoned a Parliament, degraded the poore ſeely king, and thruſt him into a Monaſtery, and <hi>Pipine</hi> was ſworne and proclaimed King of thoſe ſo many kingdomes and Sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nories, as were then ſubiect to the Crowne of France.<note place="margin">There remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth teſtimony hereof in the Decretals. <hi>C.

                  </note> Hence had it's firſt beginning, and that hand and power giuen vnto Popes, in ſo great a buſineſſe, as the ſetting vp and pulling downe of Kings; and which is more, of creating new Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours,
<pb n="432" facs="tcp:180809:227"/>
and depriuing the old ones of their Empire. Whereof there are many examples. And that which this Pope did with that King, who had no more then that vmbratill, and apparent power, other Popes afterwards did the like with <hi>Henries</hi> and <hi>Fredericks,</hi> and other Tyrants of great puiſance and power. The one offend in the more: the other in the leſſe. The one, out of the ambition that they haue to bee Kings, that they may command, and doe all, looſe all, and ſo go to hell. And the other go the ſame way, for that they will not bee (as they ſhould be) Kings, but giue themſelues wholly vnto idleneſſe. It was the Emperour <hi>Galba's</hi> vtter ouerthrow, that he had put the whole gouernment into onely three mens hands, which he brought along with him, poſſeſſing them with ſo much power, that hee was not Maſter of himſelfe, depending ſtill vpon their wil, and through that great autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie which they had, they ouerthrew all whatſoeuer their King did ordaine, thruſting their armes (as we ſay) vp to the elbowes in all affaires, and making vſe of their preſent for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune. And for that this vnfortunate Emperour could take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of no more, then what hee had from them; for none (without their permiſſion) could, or ſee, or ſpeake with him, they made him to do that, which that other Potter did, who going about to make a pot, to boyle meate in, made a Iarre, to put drinke in. And he thinking to ſubſtitute Iudges, that ſhould adminiſter Iuſtice, appointed theeues in their place, which robbed the Commonwealth. All which was imputed vnto him. And for that Vanity is the mother of ſo many vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, all this their great fauour ſerued to no other vſe, but to cauſe their Soueraigne to commit many actions of iniuſtice, and indiſcretion, and of vnheard of, and vnthought of wrongs, violently breaking through the ordinary courſe of Iuſtice. By which exorbitant proceedings, this imprudent Emperour grew to be hated and abhorred of all, and not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing able longer to beare with him, they depriued him at once of his life, and Empire. And theſe kinde of Caterpillars (ſaid

the Emperour <hi>Sigiſmund</hi>) make thoſe Kings vnfortunate,<note place="margin">Aeneas Silue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter de doct.

At this careleſſe ward, liued at firſt <hi>Ageſilaus,</hi> King of the <hi>Lacedemonians,</hi> though after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards (like a wiſe Prince) hee did rectifie this errour. And the caſe was this; Hee let his friend and Fauourite <hi>Liſander</hi> carry a great hand ouer him, and did honour him in all that he could, expreſſing alwayes much loue vnto him; <hi>Lyſander</hi> puft vp herewith, tooke great ſtate vpon him, being attended with a great traine, and manifeſting in his very gate a kinde of extraordinary grauitie and Maieſtie; and all did ſo farre forth ſerue and obey him, that it ſeemed he had vſurped the dignitie royall, and the Empire, leauing good honeſt <hi>Age<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſilaus</hi> onely the bare Titulary name of King. Which his Maieſtie taking into his conſideration, to the end that the people might not ſay, that hee raigned by <hi>Lyſanders</hi> helpe, he withdrew the diſpatch of buſineſſes from forth his hands, and would not remit any thing vnto him, and if he ſpake to him touching this or that buſineſſe, he made as if he did not heare him, or not well vnderſtand him, diſpatching all him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, to the good contentment of his Subiects. Hereupon <hi>Lyſander</hi> began to caſt vp his accounts with himſelfe, and forbore from that time forward to conferre fauours, or to promiſe Offices; and told ſuch ſuiters as came vnto h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>m, that they ſhould go themſelues to petition the King, and would by no meanes permit, that they ſhould accompany him to Court, as before. And yet notwithſtanding all this, he aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed very carefully in all ſuch ſeruices, as were by his Maieſty recommended vnto him, without any the leaſt ſhew of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contentment. Within a while after occaſion was offered vnto him to ſpeake with the King; and talking with him, hee told him; O King, how well haſt thou learned to make thy friends leſſe? yes (quoth the King) when they will make themſelues too great. The King played his part well, ſo did the Fauourite, and all ought to doe the like. Kings muſt bore a hole in that ſhip with their owne hand, to ſtop it's courſe,
<pb n="434" facs="tcp:180809:228"/>
when it hoyſeth it's ſayles too high, and goes with too ſtill a gale. For the taking notice of their Fauourites ambition, is that ballaſt, which doth ſecure them againſt thoſe their windes, and puffes of vanitie.</p>
               <p>Let then the firſt aduice, and which is of greateſt impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance for Kings and Chriſtian kingdomes, bee that which (amongſt other) the Catholicke King of Spaine, and Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour <hi>Charles</hi> the fifth, left vnto his ſonne King <hi>Philip</hi> the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond, wherein with many indeared and effectuall words, he recommends vnto him the obſeruing, augmenting, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fending of the Chriſtian faith, in all his kingdomes, States, and Signiories, ſeuerely puniſhing with all rigour and iuſtice, without exception of perſons, all ſuch as ſhould bee either ſuſpected or found culpable in points of Hereſies, Errours, and depraued Sects, contrary to the Catholicke faith. For therein conſiſteth all our good words, all of them, worthie conſideration, and worthy ſo Catholicke a Prince, eſteemed, approued, and perpetually obſerued by his moſt happie ſonne (howbeit to his great coſt.) As one, that knew very well, that in the obſeruance of Religion, and Catholicke faith, all the happineſſe that we can hope for in this or that other life, dependeth thereupon, and hath it's ſure ground and foundation.<note place="margin">Heb. 11.1.</note> And therefore Saint <hi>Paul</hi> calls it <hi>Subſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiam rerum ſperandarum, &amp;c.</hi> Faith is the ſubſtance of things hoped for, and the euidence of things not ſeene, &amp;c. For it is the foundation whereupon is built in our ſoules all our ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall good: inſomuch that the ſelfe ſame Apoſtle ſaid, <hi>Sine fide, &amp;c.</hi> Without faith it is impoſſible to pleaſe God. And ſeeing it is a Iewell of ſuch great worth and value, Kings are to make that eſteeme of it, that they doe not onely retaine it, but maintaine and defend it, eſpecially in their owne kingdomes, and in all other places, where they haue any power. For beſides the obligation, which they haue, as Chriſtian Kings, it concernes them likewiſe in their owne proper intereſt. For in giuing way to their Subiects, that they
<pb n="435" facs="tcp:180809:228"/>
be not faithfull vnto God, it will pull that puniſhment vpon them, that they ſhall not be loyall vnto them. And moſt cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine it is, that they who ſhall not cumply with the greater obligation, ſhall eaſily faile in the letter. And this is made cleare vnto vs in the ſacred Hiſtory of the Kings; where, whoſoeuer ſhall diligently obſerue the ſame, hee ſhall finde, That after <hi>Ieroboam,</hi> King of Iſrael,<note place="margin">3. King. 13.</note> had ſet vp thoſe Idolls in <hi>Dan,</hi> and <hi>Bethel,</hi> of purpoſe to withdraw the people from the true worſhip of God, were commended and continued (as there wee may reade) the treaſons and rebellions of the Subiects againſt their Kings. For this vnfortunate Prince thought with himſelfe, that for to ſettle and ſecure himſelfe in the kingdome by thoſe ten Tribes, which had rebelled, and made choice of him for their King, that it would be a good meanes to induce them to his deuotion, to draw them to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go the adoration of the true God, which they were wont to performe in the holy Citie, and Temple of Ieruſalem, and to humble and proſtrate themſelues before thoſe Idolls. But the iuſt vengeance of God ouertooke him; for inſtantly there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon he loſt his eldeſt ſonne, who dyed a violent death. For <hi>Baaſha,</hi> the ſonne of <hi>Ahijah,</hi> of the houſe of <hi>Iſſachar,</hi> conſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red againſt him, and ſmote him at <hi>Gibbethon,</hi> and anon after all the houſe of <hi>Ieroboam,</hi> not leauing vnto him any that breathed. And not onely hee, and his, did miſcarry, but the whole kingdome was laid waſte and deſolate for that ſinne, and led away captiue. And as when one man hath receiued from another ſome extraordinary great wrong, he can hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly forget it: ſo, vpon all occaſions, wherein mention is made of the ſinnes of the Kings, which afterwards ſucceeded, and of the puniſhment which they deſerued for them, ſtill is the remembrance reuiued of this moſt grieuous ſinne of <hi>Ierobo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ams,</hi> and are attributed vnto him, as being the firſt that open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the gappe vnto them. And all thoſe troubles which are there particularly ſet downe in thoſe ſacred bookes, befell that kingdome for a puniſhment to them, and a warning to
<pb n="436" facs="tcp:180809:229"/>
all Chriſtian Kings, that by how much the greater light they haue for to know the excellencie of Faith, and the truth of Chriſtian Religion; ſo much the leſſe are they to be obey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and the more ſeuerely to bee puniſhed, if they ſhould be wanting to ſo great and ſo apparent an obligation. Let Chriſtian Kings therefore know, that if they ſhall conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue firme in the faith, and cauſe all their ſubiects to continue conſtant therein, God will protect both King and people, and will eſtabliſh their kingdomes, and all ſhall obey and feare them; but if they ſhall faile therein, all runs to wracke, and vtter ruine. So that, as a naile, if you will haue it to hold, muſt be faſtened in ſome other thing that is firme and ſtrong, leſt it, and all that hangs thereon, come tumbling downe to the ground. So in like manner, if a King will vphold himſelfe firme and ſure in his power, Maieſtie, and greatneſſe, hee muſt be firmely fixed to the faith, ſtrongly vnited with God, and cloſe wedged to his diuine will: but if he begin once to ſinke, or ſhrinke in this, all his kingdomes, or whatſoeuer de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend thereon, come tumbling downe to the ground, with a ſudden and fearefull fall. For nothing doth more vphold a ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciable life, a Monarchie, and kingdome, then Religion linked with Iuſtice. <hi>Noah</hi> for his Religion and Iuſtice, was after the Flood obeyed by all. The Romans, for the vpholding and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larging of their Empire, held not any meanes comparable to that of Religion and Iuſtice, wherein they ſurpaſſed all of thoſe times. The Emperour <hi>Seuerus</hi> being at the point of death (which is a time for men to ſpeake truth) ended his life with theſe words, <hi>Firmum imperium filijs meis relinquo, ſi boni erunt; Imbecille, ſi mali:</hi> A ſtrong Empire leaue I to my Sonnes, if they proue good; a weake, if bad. For the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt force and ſtrength of a kingdome, both for the preſent, and the future, is the vertue of it's king. So that with no lime and ſand are the walls and foundations of States more firme and ſurely ſetled for laſting and continuance, then with a Kings vertue and goodneſſe. Which is that recompence and
<pb n="437" facs="tcp:180809:229"/>
reward which God promiſed to his moſt faithfull ſeruant <hi>Dauid,</hi> for his vertue. <hi>Firmaboregnum ei<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Let vs draw then from this diſcourſe and ſound aduice of this Catholike Emperour, how much it importeth Kings to maintaine their faith and Religion, and to conſerue and vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold the ſame in all their kingdomes and dominions. Now for to conſerue the faith, it is likewiſe requiſite, that there be great care had in procuring, that the commonwealth be pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged and cleanſed of it's vices and ſinnes. For (as the Apoſtle Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith) when vices grow to that head and rank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, that they come to make men to be of a bad and corrupt conſcience, they go diſpoſing ſuch to ſuffer ſhipwracke in the faith; as it hath happened in theſe our times, in many parts of Europe.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="438" facs="tcp:180809:230"/>The ſecond aduice that I ſhall giue vnto Kings, is, that they carry themſelues ſo in the diſpatch of buſineſſes, that notice may not bee taken, that they are diſpatched by any other arbitrement, but their owne. For moſt certaine it is, that if it come to be knowne, that all the Orders that come forth, paſſe through the Fauourites hands, and as hee ſhall giue direction, they looſe much of their force and efficacie<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and the King much of his reputation and credit. His ſubiects will grow to contemne him; and ſtrangers will make little reckoning of him; and many other miſchiefes will enſue thereupon. Amongſt the Romanes it was held for a great affront and diſhonour, that the Emperour ſhould diſpatch (as they ſay) <hi>porcarta-pacio,</hi> by a note booke, or ſome penn'd thing for him; or (like ſome young practitioner in phyſicke) by his Maiſters <hi>Recipes.</hi> And therefore in thoſe generall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſions, which they made, they beſought God that hee would not puniſh them, by giuing them Princes, which had need to be ruled and guided by Gouernours and Tutors. For they knew well enough, that when God is angry, offended with the ſinnes of the people, he puniſheth them, by ſending them Princes without knowledge and wiſedome; that are not able to gouerne of themſelues, but to doe as others ſhall ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſe them. Wherein they did confeſſe and acknowledge, That to be a King, conſiſteth in being knowne and reueren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced of all; to be an independant Lord, not relying vpon any other; whoſe Mandates and Decrees all ſhould ſubſcribe vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to and obey; whom all ſhould ſeeke vnto, with whom all ſhould negociate, that are pretenders; from whoſe liberalitie, reſolution, and will, they onely ſhould acknowledge all the graces and fauours that are done them, and from no other hand. For if they ſhould giue way thereunto, their Subiects will bee induced eaſily to beleeue, that together with this, they will giue away their greatneſſe, and miniſter occaſion to looſe that common loue and reſpect which ſolely and proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly is due vnto them. For Subiects vſually honour no other
<pb n="439" facs="tcp:180809:230"/>
Sunne, but that from which they receiue their light. They naturally abhorre that man, that does them hurt; and loue that perſon, who does them good, bee he what hee will be, good or bad, all is one. They call God <hi>Optimum maximum,</hi> becauſe he both doth, and is able to do them good. And he himſelfe doth glory therein, as being vnwilling that men ſhould acknowledge the good they receiue, from any other. What wiſedome then can there bee in that King, that ſhall ſuffer a Fauourite to haue all the thankes, and all the honour and glory of thoſe fauours and rewards, whereof he is the owner and donor? Reſeruing for himſelfe nothing but the ſcorne and contempt of his Subiects, then the which there is no miſerie can be greater? God forbid that Kings ſhould per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit any ſuch leſſening of their power and authoritie, which is the neceſſarieſt thing that can bee, for the conſeruation of their eſtates and kingdomes. Likewiſe in regard of their owne proper particular, it will be a very good leſſon for them; for if their ſubiects are beholding for the good they receiue, vnto another, they will loue him more then them; and when oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion ſhall ſerue, will not ſticke to ſhew it, though it bee to their owne hurt. Examples hereof, there are good ſtore amongſt thoſe ancient Kings and kingdomes of elder times, that by this meanes haue beene ouerthrowne and brought to ruine. We finde it ſtoried, that the Emperour <hi>Claudius,</hi> at the interceſſion and inſtance of <hi>Agrippina,</hi> made ſuch a one Generall of his Army; <hi>Cornelius Tacitus</hi> toucheth vpon this Myſterie, and ſaith of him, that hee was a man of much fame and renowne, and very expert in militarie diſcipline; yet knowing very well withall, by whoſe good will and fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therance, that command was conferred vpon him, he could not (when occaſion ſhould offer) bee behinde hand for ſo great an honour done vnto him, but recompence it to the vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt of his power. Such great places of imployment ought to be beſtowed by no hand, but by Kings, and that imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately, leſt another may go away with the thankes. And he
<pb n="440" facs="tcp:180809:231"/>
ſhall doe well, if hee take the like courſe in all other Offices that are in his gift; for (if it were poſſible) it is fit that all ſhould ſtand bound and obliged to him.</p>
               <p>Let Kings likewiſe bee aduiſed, that they carry a watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full eye ouer thoſe that are ambitious, which are either ſo na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally, or by conuerſing and communicating with others, are made ſo (for this is an infectious diſeaſe) and the more, the more it taketh hold on great perſons, and men of an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary ſpirit; for they are as dangerous as theeues, where there is ſtore of treaſure to bee had. For queſtionleſſe ſuch kinde of men do vſually labour to increaſe their eſtate. For it is very naturall to this paſſion, as to thoſe other affections, neuer to giue ouer, till they come to the end and full ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of that which their appetite or deſire repreſenteth vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them: neither the Law of God, nor of thankfulneſſe, ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficing to moderate their mindes, and to keepe them within the due and lawfull bounds of their dutie. In that houre, and in that very inſtant of their riſing, nay, before they come to that greatneſſe, there is little truſt to be giuen vnto them; for nothing workes vpon them, but their proper honour and profit. And all the reſt they eſteeme as nothing, in compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of bettring their owne fortune.

Nam huiuſmodi homines aptiſsimi ſunt ad inuadendum circa res omnes:</hi> Let them not be of baſe and meane condition, nor ſuch as are naturally proud and haughty, for being vainely tranſported with their fauour and priuacie, they thinke with themſelues, that they haue already clapt a nayle in fortunes wheele, and that they cannot fall from the top of their feli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citie. And being thus blinded with their ambition, there is not any thing which they dare not aduenture on. Let Kings therefore well weigh and conſider with themſelues, what manner of men they put into great places, and neare about their perſons, that they may relye more on the goodneſſe of
<pb n="441" facs="tcp:180809:231"/>
their nature and diſpoſition, then on the Law of obligation and thankfulneſſe; for theſe are but weake bonds, and eaſily broken. And becauſe I know not whether I ſhall hereafter come to light vpon the like occaſion, I will here propoſe that Queſtion, which is diſputed and doubted of by ſome (and may likewiſe ſerue for an <hi>Auiſo</hi> vnto Kings) whether it be better that the great Lords ſhould be farre off from them, or neare about them? The Emperour <hi>Charles</hi> the fifth (of fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous memory) amongſt other Aduertiſements which hee gaue to his ſonne <hi>Philip,</hi> one was, That he ſhould not let the great offices of the kingdome, nor places of great command reſt any long time in one mans hands, nor ſhould put his <hi>Grandes</hi> and great Lords into them, but Gentlemen of good qualitie, ſuch as were creatures of his owne making. And as for his <hi>Grandes,</hi> hee ſhould honour them with ſome places and offices neare about his perſon, which would be a greater grace both to himſelfe and his Court.</p>
               <p>Others are of a quite contrary opinion, and alledge reaſons for the maintenance thereof. Great men (they ſay) if they be not like thoſe little ones, which Chriſt ſpeaketh of, are ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily of an extraordinary ſpirit, and endeauour, all they can, increaſe of honour, till they come to occupie the higheſt place. And then will it bee ſeene, of what little eſteeme are thoſe great fauours which they haue already receiued. There is not that friendſhip, that kindred, nor any other bond, be it neuer ſo ſtrong, which is not broken, through the greedy ambition of aſcending to ſome higher throne. For to bee a King (ſaith <hi>Euripides</hi>) all Law is broken. For this Appetite is of that force and ſtrength, that it breaketh all Lawes, both Diuine and Humane. For proofe whereof, they cite many examples, which I purpoſely omit, that I may not offend, and tire out the Reader. All of them admoniſhing Kings, that they ſhould throughly weigh and conſider where, and in what places they put them. For if they be neare about their royall perſon, it is the torment of <hi>Tantalus</hi> vnto them, to ſee
<pb n="442" facs="tcp:180809:232"/>
the warre and the fruit ſo neare their mouth (that great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and power I meane) and not to enioy it; Which will but prouoke a more hungry appetite in thoſe which doe not poſſeſſe it, and will breake through hedge and ditch, and runne (as they ſay) through fire and water tranſported with this ſo faire and beautifull a prize, as is ſet before their eyes; neuer being at quiet till they come to enioy it. For there is not that loue to any thing here vpon earth, which doth ſo much alter, ſuſpend, and ſeaze on the minde and heart of man, as that of ruling and commanding, and to grow great therein. And when they ſee things ſucceed not according to their minde, yet at leaſt in ſatisfaction of their enuie, they will be well content that the waters ſhould be troubled, and the world be turned topſie-turuy, taking pleaſure therein, though it be to their owne hurt. And what King can ſecure himſelfe, that ſuch ambitious perſons, being neare about him, will not at one time or other attempt their ends. For greatneſſe (ſay they) after that it is once poſſeſſed, quits the memory of the meanes, whereby it came to bee ſo great, and findes a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand excuſes for it's weakneſſe in offending. And the rather, for that ill vſe hath taught all men this leſſon; That the repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of an honeſt man is not to be preferred before his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per profit and greatneſſe. Laſtly, they ſay, That he that ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commeth, and makes good his clayme by his ſword, needeth not to ſtudy excuſes, and to make Apologies; let thoſe doe that, that haue the worſt end of the ſtaffe, and ſtand at the mercy of the Conquerour. In concluſion, they reſolue this queſtion thus; That it is very fit that your great Noble-men ſhould rather liue farre from Court, then neare about their King. For all of them will be of good vſe, for the gouernment of Prouinces and Armies, whereby both the one and the other will be ſecured. And when they cannot content them in all that they would haue, they may entertaine them with theſe, which will be a good meanes to diuert their thoughts, and to bridle thoſe Prouinces that are committed to their
<pb n="443" facs="tcp:180809:232"/>
charge, with whom the Maieſtie and greatneſſe of their Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernours will be able to doe much: And there they are not of that danger. For in kingdomes by ſucceſſion, and well ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, and where there is no colour of wreſting the Scepter out of the bloud-royall, there is no feare of truſting the <hi>Grandes,</hi> and great Noblemen with theſe kinde of Gouernments, but it is rather requiſite that it ſhould be ſo. For, like vnto ſtarres in heauen, and their influences on earth, they ſerue for orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and conuerſation in thoſe kingdomes and Prouinces, wherein there are ancient and noble Houſes, for which they are to ſeeke out men of Noble bloud, and good qualitie, and of knowne greatneſſe, to bee conuerſant amongſt them. For the Nobilitie of thoſe kingdomes and Prouinces will thinke themſelues not well dealt withall, if they ſhall haue but an or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary man ſet ouer them to be their Gouernour, be he neuer ſo wiſe, or neuer ſo valiant. For being that they are to attend all at the gates of him that holdeth that place, they may eſteeme it as an iniurie to ſee themſelues obliged, to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge homage vnto him, whom out of that place they would ſence vouchſafe him their companie. Beſides, that greatneſſe and largeneſſe of minde and heart, that knowes not how to ſhrinke, or be deiected with aduerſe fortune (a thing ſo ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary in him that gouernes) will ſooner bee found in theſe, then men of meaner ranke. For (as Saint <hi>Ierome</hi> ſaith) hee that owes much to his bloud and familie, will alwayes beare that obligation about him; and neuer faile therein. Againe, he that is borne to command, will be leſſe inſolent in his go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernment, as hauing that noble qualitie from his cradle, And the people on the other ſide will more willingly obey him, whom they haue alwayes knowne to haue liued in honour and greatneſſe: And his example will bee of greater impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, to reforme the diſorders and abuſes that ſhall there be offered.</p>
               <p>Ouer and aboue, they further adde, That your <hi>Grandes</hi> and great Noblemen, may, and haue obligation to content
<pb n="444" facs="tcp:180809:233"/>
themſelues with their preſent eſtate, if they will but weigh the difference of that it was, with that which it is now, did not men that are now in honour grow forgetfull of their former meane condition. That grieuing them more, which falls ſhort of their deſire, then that doth pleaſe and content them, which fortune hath with ſo liberall a hand beſtowed on them. For no man reſts contented with his preſent eſtate and condition; nor doe we eſteeme that ſo much which wee poſſeſſe, as the lacke of that we deſire, doth torment vs. And therefore doe they ſay, that they are not ſo good to be about Kings, and more particularly thoſe which are ſo qualified; for they are like a ling<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Or like vnto the hand in a Clocke, or Dyall, which tells out the houre, and ſtrikes, without perceiuing how it moues or goes. Or like vnto thoſe plants of your talleſt trees, which grow to their full height, whileſt neither our eyes, nor our vnderſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding can ſcarce comprehend, how this comes to paſſe, ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſibly doth it ſproute and ſhoot vp. This is the queſtion, and theſe, in briefe, the conueniences, which (for mine owne part) I know not what they are, vnleſſe ſuch conueniences as are proper to euery one in their owne eſtate. But be it as it may be, and let them ſay what they liſt, let Kings reſolue by the illumination of that light which they haue from hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, on that which ſhall be beſt for them. That which I ſay, is this. That it will well become them to liue with a great deale of warineſſe and circumſpection, and not to truſt or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye too much vpon fortune. For this Lady, howbeit ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times ſhee ſuffers her ſelfe to bee commanded by them, yet now and then ſhe ouerrules them, as ſhe doth the reſt. And therefore it ſhall bee good diſcretion and prudence to feare both her, and her frequent mutabilities and changings, as it behoueth euery man to doe the like. For ſhe, without any reſpect or diſtinction of perſons, will oftentimes laſh out
<pb n="445" facs="tcp:180809:233"/>
from that way and courſe wherein ſhe is, and runne a quite contrary bias, and commit the current of thoſe effects to time and Nature.</p>
               <p>Let Kings likewiſe take heed, that they doe not put offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded perſons into ſuch places, where they may reuenge them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues; For a receiued wrong or iniurie leaues ſtill ſome roots behinde, which, when occaſion is offered, will bud forth moſt bitter and venemous plants. Nor are there any rewards, or benefits, be they neuer ſo great, that can blot out the print of that impreſſion, which an iniurie ſtampeth in the minde and heart of man. Courteſies are ſoone forgotten by them; for it ſeemeth a troubleſome thing vnto them, to endure the weight and burthen of ſo great a debt and obligation; but a receiued wrong or iniurie, that ſhall euer be remembred, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they hold reuenge to be the character of courage, and the badge of a noble minde and braue ſpirit. <hi>Puluere, qui lae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit, ſcribit, ſed marmore laeſus:</hi> He that does a wrong, writes it downe in duſt; but he that receiues it, in marble. <hi>Tacitus</hi> teacheth vs to know this minde of man, and it's paſſions; telling vs that the greateſt and ſtrongeſt inclination in man, is to receiue ſatisfaction of the iniuries done vnto them, for thankfulneſſe lyes as a heauy loade vpon them; whereas they make light of thoſe benefits they receiue. Eſteeming the latter to be a diminution of their greatneſſe; and the ſormer, to wit, reuenge, to bee a great gaine vnto them; for they imagine, that they gaine thereby in their authoritie, in their reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and in the manifeſtation of their valour, when the world ſhall take notice that they haue righted themſelues: Such as theſe can neither bee good as they are Fauourites, nor as they are Councellers. For out of the deſire and pleaſure they take in reuenge, they will rather aduiſe that which ſhall ſeeme conuenient for the execution thereof, then for the authoritie and profit of the Prince, whom they aduiſe. They will aduiſe him (I ſay) to venture himſelfe vpon ſome voyage, to enter into a warre, to go himſelfe into the field with a royall army,
<pb n="446" facs="tcp:180809:234"/>
or to vndergo ſome dangerous enterpriſe, for the better effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting of their deſignes, plotting a thouſand miſchiefes to bring him vnto ruine. And let them ſay what they will, yet ſhall they neuer perſwade me, that this proceeds out of the loue which they beare vnto their King, and his increaſe of honour, but out of hatred to his perſon, &amp; their owne proper ſatisfaction, thinking that by that meanes they may worke their reuenge. And hereunto I adde, that no man can bee found of ſo perfect a minde, of ſo temperate a nature, and ſo vertuous, but that in the firſt place he will treate of his owne buſineſſe; and that treating of this particular, the eye of his thought ſtill ayming to hit this white, will not ſticke to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenture any danger in hope of reuenge. And therefore I ſhall aduiſe Kings, that of neceſſitie muſt ſometimes giue eare and credit to theſe or the like perſons, if they chance to bee preferred to great places, that they be very carefull how farre forth they truſt them, for they are a dangerous kinde of peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, vnſafe, and more couetous of their owne priuate intereſt, then carefull of the publike perill, or common hurt. For this loue vnto themſelues, and hatred vnto others, couered and ſtrewed ouer with the cloud and aſhes of iniuries and offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, either receiued or conceiued, doth reuiue and quicken the coales by thoſe blaſts of fauour and greatneſſe that are blowne on them; procuring (though to others coſt) to vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold themſelues therein, and to ingage Kings in that which they pretend for their reuenge and ſatisfaction. God ſhield and protect Kings from ſuch perſons, as ſhall with the ſnake take vp their poyſon againe, to vent the venome of their ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour and reuenge vpon an old quarrell; and let them likewiſe take heed, how they imploy their forces, and their power, in countenancing and protecting thoſe whom they haue offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded and diſcontented.</p>
               <p>This (ſaith the ſaid Emperour <hi>Charles</hi> the fifth) is an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice of great importance, for the ſafetie, quietude, and good gouernment of kingdomes, States, and Signiories; which
<pb n="447" facs="tcp:180809:234"/>
for that they are ſo many, ſo great, and ſo farre diſtant one from another, it is impoſſible that they ſhould be viſited by your ſelfe in perſon, ſo often as is requiſite: And therefore I aduiſe you, that you haue a great care that your Viceroyes and Gouernours that ſhall be ſent thither, be ſuch, and of ſuch parts, as ſhall conuene for ſuch an imployment, men of expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience, and conſcience, of wiſedome, prudence, and diſcre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and well ſeene in matters of State and Gouernment: Well diſpoſed, and free from couetouſneſſe, briberie, and corruption; ſeeking out rather men for Offices, then Offices for men. Laſtly, let them be ſuch perſons, from whom you may receiue that good ſatisfaction, that by their reſidence there may bee found no miſſe of their Kings preſence; For this is properly to bee Vice-royes. Moreouer, you muſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct them in that which appertaineth vnto them, for the good gouernment of the Commonwealth, and thoſe Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects which are committed to their charge, maintaining them in equall iuſtice, and good manners, giuing them good ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample by their owne blameleſſe conuerſation. There is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing that doth ſo much oblige Vaſſals and Subiects to keepe the Statutes and Lawes which are ordained, as to ſee them well kept and obſerued by their betters; And ſo it is, that it is vniuſtly commanded, which hee that commands keepes not himſelfe, if that which is commanded be good. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing good, why ſhould it not be good for him to keepe it, that commands it?<note place="margin">Bal. in l. <hi>2</hi> c. <hi>8.</hi> Num. <hi>4.</hi> C. de Serui.</note> For (as <hi>Baldus</hi> ſaith) though the King be not lyable to the Law, yet is hee lyable to the rules of reaſon. This pious Emperour goes on, and willeth his ſonne, that he ſhould ſtrictly recommend to his Vice-roys charge, the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tecting, ſheltring, and relieuing of the poore, the defending of the fatherleſſe and widow, and thoſe that are deſtitute of friends, and haue none to helpe them. Whom ſome, that are in place and authoritie, are wont (and I feare is too ordinary amongſt them) to disfauour and diſeſteeme them, making little or no reckoning at all of them. Being ignorant how vile
<pb n="448" facs="tcp:180809:235"/>
and baſe a thing it is, and how heroycall the contrary, and how much in imitation of God, to put forth a charitable and pitifull hand to him that is brought low, and fallen into mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerie, aſſiſting him in his afflictions and troubles, freeing him from wrongs and iniuries, whoſe ſhield and buckler, he that gouernes, ought to be. And he cloſes vp this aduertiſement with wiſhing him to be very carefull, that his Viceroys and Gouernours exerciſe their offices as they ought, and not to exceed the inſtructions that are giuen them, nor to vſurpe beyond their authoritie, giuing them this <hi>prouiſo,</hi> that in do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the contrary, he ſhall thinke that he is ill ſerued by them, and that hee giue order to haue it remedied and amended, by his diſpleaſure, and their puniſhment. And howbeit it be true, that he ought not to giue credit to all the complaints which are made againſt ſuch his Miniſters (which are ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome wanting) yet in no hand that he ſhould refuſe to heare them, and vnderſtand them, in forming himſelfe fully of the truth. For the not doing of it, will but miniſter occaſion vnto them, to be more abſolute, and to the Subiects to grow deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate, ſeeing themſelues oppreſſed by iniuſtice and vncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcionable dealing.</p>
               <p>Likewiſe when Kings ſend an Embaſſadour to another Prince, they muſt looke well into the qualitie of the perſon whom they ſend. For in ſuch an Embaſſage he doth not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly treate of the buſineſſes for which hee goes, but likewiſe of the honour and authoritie of the King, which ſends him. And therefore it is neceſſary that the perſons that are nomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated and declared to go on Embaſſage, haue many of thoſe qualities, which we haue mentioned in Vice-roys and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellours of State. For if they ſhall not fill that place with the greatneſſe of their good abilities, it will be a great leſſening to the credit and reputation of the King, and the buſineſſes will receiue much hinderance, if not vtterly bee ouerthrowne. The Romanes did make a mocke of the Teutones, counting them no better then fooles, for ſending an Embaſſadour vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<pb n="449" facs="tcp:180809:235"/>
them that was a block-head, and of little or no expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience.</p>
               <p>Kings and great Princes, all that, from which glory and greatneſſe reſulteth vnto them, they ought to doe it without any the leaſt ſhew of vanitie, accompanying it with ſuch cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances and conſequencies, that it may ſeeme onely to bee done for the common good, the exaltation of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth, and the reputation of their Crowne. In all times and places they muſt repreſent much authoritie, grauitie, and Maieſtie in their perſons, and in their Treaties, mixing it with affabilitie and courteſie. To the end, that by the one they may cauſe feare and reſpect, and by the other quit and remoue that feare. It is reported of <hi>Octauian</hi> the Emperour, that all the Embaſſadours that appeared in his preſence, ſtood aſtoniſhed betwixt feare and admiration; but no ſooner ſpake he vnto them, but they were wonderfully taken with his words, and did not then ſo much feare, as affect him. For albeit the Maieſtie where with hee receiued them, was excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding great, yet was his carriage towards them very affable, and very courteous. In theſe two vertues, did excell that Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholicke King of Spaine, <hi>Don Philip</hi> the ſecond, whom for the repreſenting of Maieſtie, and regall authoritie, none did excell, and few equall. And in the carriage and compoſition of his perſon, there was no defect to bee found. Vpon any accident that befell him, were it good or bad, fortunate or vnfortunate, there was neuer any man that could perceiue in him ſo much as a diſcompoſed countenance, or any other the leaſt alteration. And hee may be truly ſaid to be a man, who is not proud in proſperitie, nor impatient in aduerſitie. For it is a great ſigne of Nobleneſſe, and the vndoubted marke of a royall minde, and Princely courage, not to looſe himſelfe in his aduerſer fortunes, but to ſhew himſelfe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant againſt fortune, and to raiſe vp his ſpirits, as this King did, being neuer deiected with any outward Croſſe or miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune, tha befell him. He did neuer (being therein like vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<pb n="450" facs="tcp:180809:236"/>
to <hi>Xenophous Cyrus</hi>) ſhew an ill countenance, or ſpeake an ill word vnto any man. Hee was not ſo affable and familiar with his Fauourites, that any of them all durſt preſume to pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition him in any thing that was vniuſt; nor yet ſo auſtere and ſeuere towards others as to make them to forbeare to preferre a iuſt ſuite vnto him. To his owne Subiects he was kinde, to ſtrangers noble; but withall, reſeruing ſtill his au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie and greatneſſe. For Kings ought not to bee ſo harſh and intractable, as to make themſelues to bee abhorred; nor ſo kinde and courteous, as to cauſe themſelues to be contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned. Indeauouring all they can, not to fall into the extreames, by ſhewing too much loue to ſome, and little or none at all to other ſome. For too much ſeueritie ingendreth hatred, and too much familiaritie breedeth contempt. Let them general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly beare themſelues in that reſpectiue manner towards all, that they honour the better, loue the meaner ſort, and deſpiſe not the reſt; but as farre as they are able, extend their grace and fauour vnto all. For that being but little, which they haue to giue, in compariſon of the many that are ſutors, and the great rewards which they pretend, they reſt better ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied with thoſe good words, and mannerly anſwers, that are giuen them, then with thoſe fauours that are done them. For the generous hearts, modeſt countenances, and ingeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous diſpoſitions of thoſe noble ſpirits which follow Princes Courts, much more riſent the disfauour that is done them in receiuing courteſies with diſgrace, then if they were denyed them. And therefore it is good wholeſome counſell, and much importing Kings, to returne a faire and equall anſwer vnto all, according to each mans qualitie and merit, and that they carry the ſame euen hand in the conferting of their fauours, and in the manifeſtation of their loue. And if they ſhall in a more particular manner, expreſſe the ſame to ſome one par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular perſon, let him likewiſe more particularly deſerue it. For neuer ſhall that loue be ſtedfaſt, where deſerts are want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the partie beloued.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="451" facs="tcp:180809:236"/>I ſhall likewiſe aduertiſe Kings, that they doe not make ſuch vſe of this their great both office and power, as to aſſume vnto themſelues to be abſolute, and to cumply in all things with their affections and deſires, nor to exerciſe any other perſonall paſſion. For the vſe and cuſtome of abſolute power is dangerous for Kings, odious to the ſubiect, and offenſiue both to God and Nature. And for that the laſt Kings of the Romanes vſed this power, the name of King grew ſo hate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, that thoſe that afterwards ſucceeded in the Romane go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernment, durſt not take vpon them the name of Kings, but that of Emperours. Which is by ſo much the more abſolute, by how much <hi>Imperare</hi> doth differ from <hi>Regere.</hi> Yet not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding the people of Rome did not ſo much feare this name of Emperour, as that of King, becauſe thoſe, that laſt bore that name, exerciſed on them this their abſolute power. So that it is not the name, nor the office, but the ill vſing thereof that makes it odious. For it is neither the Title, nor the Man, that moueth or altereth the honeſt meaning minde of the plaine downe right ſubiect, but deeds and actions, that are done contrary to all right and reaſon. Whereas on the contrary, good vſage, and good treatment keepes them in loue and peace, and drawes them after him as it were in a ſtring, and to offer vp for his ſake a voluntary ſacrifice of their liues. Let Kings conſider that the Crowne ſpeakes as much, which they weare on their heads in forme of a Spheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call round figure, which ſignifies <hi>limitem,</hi> or <hi>terminum,</hi> a li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit or bound, or rather that Circle, out of which it is not lawfull for them to go, no not one ſteppe. The Crownes (I ſay) that they weare, are Circles and Limits, ſeruing to put them in minde, that their power is limited and meaſured out vnto them, that they may not paſſe the bounds of reaſon nor doe any thing, but what is iuſt and lawfull. Let the great Kings and Potentates of the earth moderate themſelues, and refraine from making themſelues Gods, by exerciſing this their abſolute power; let them acknowledge ouer them a

                  </note> For (as <hi>Seneca</hi> ſaith) <hi>Quod non poteſt, vult poſſe, qui nimium poteſt.</hi> But the God of heauen is very nice and tender in admitting companions in any kinde of manner whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer, but much more daintie in matter of iuriſdiction and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute power, puniſhing the ſame with grieuous chaſtiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and many demonſtrations of his fearefull anger and diſpleaſure. <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> ſaith, that through the gouernment of thoſe that are too abſolute in their rule and command, the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernment is changed, kingdomes altered, and petty Princes riſe vp againſt them, who in ſuch ſort abate and bring downe their pride, that they come to ſerue thoſe, whom before they did command. <hi>Tully</hi> tearmes them, of all other, the moſt mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable, which make their will a Law, and thinke that they may doe all that they can. <hi>Nero</hi> did then leaue off to be cruell, when he vnderſtood that he was permitted to doe what hee liſted; and that many did approue all his actions for good. It is the ancient language of adulation, to ſpeake abſolute power vnto Princes, and to perſwade them to follow their owne free will. But this is a very dangerous thing, if they once giue way thereunto, and let ſuch flatteries dwell in their eares; for the reſolutions of ſuch a power, will not ſuffer themſelues to be ſo ſubiect, as they ought, to the iudgement of reaſon, nor humane diſcourſe. In ſuch a caſe, a power from heauen is more needfull. And this errour is now come to be in ſuch re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt, that to agree in all things with the will and pleaſure of Kings, is now made in the minds of ſome, not onely a meanes of hope, but eſteemed as a great ſeruice, and pledge of merit, to receiue honours and rewards. But this deceitfull meanes, whereby they thinke to thriue, ſhall (when God ſhall ſee it fit) be the onely knife to cut their throates; for ſuch kinde of men neuer eſcape puniſhment, and moſt commonly receiue it
<pb n="453" facs="tcp:180809:237"/>
from their Kings owne hand. In ſtrange and extraordinary caſes, and vpon iuſt occaſions, and iuſtifiable meanes, Kings may ſomewhat inlarge the limits of their power, ſo as they doe not go beyond that which reaſon and Chriſtian pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence permitteth. <hi>Plato</hi> ſaith, that Prudence and power are to embrace each other, and to walke hand in hand. Qualities which ought to concurre in a good King, ſignified in that Scepter with eyes, which <hi>Ieremy</hi> ſaw, power being in the one, and wiſdome in the other. And in that other old ancient por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traiture of a good King, being a Lion placed on the top of <hi>Mercuries</hi> Mace, which is a Scepter with two Snakes twi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning about it; This, ſignifying prudence, and wiſedome, and that fortitude; which ſhould neuer be ſeparated from a King. By his power, he is feared, reſpected, and obeyed; he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, prohibites, and executes. By his wiſedome, he auer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth the truth of his actions, and doth nothing, but what is lawfull. Wiſedome tempereth power; and both together vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold the world. But if power forſake the fellowſhip of wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, it growes to be abſolute, and runnes into a thouſand indiſcretions, and commits as many wrongs and iniuries, wherewith it deſolateth and deſtroyeth euen the greateſt States. For, there is not that ill, wherein power doth not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed, if it haue not wiſedome for it's bridle. And for that a powerfull hand is ſo dangerous a thing, Nature hath ordai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and ſo ordered the buſineſſe, that the braine where wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome hath it's reſidence, ſhould bee placed ouer it.

               <p>The particular and generall experience which we haue of Hiſtories, teacheth vs, how much it importeth for the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeruation and augmentation of a great Empire and Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chie, that he, that is Lord and Maſter thereof (if it lye diui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded through diuers parts of the world, by ſeas, and enemies, in the midſt thereof) ſhould ſtriue and indeauour by all poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible meanes to make himſelfe likewiſe Lord and Maſter of the ſea: for thereby ſhall he come to bee Lord and Maſter of the Land. And an abſolute diſpenſer of thoſe things, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with we ſuſtaine our ſelues, and liue. For by the helpe of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uigation, we paſſe from one part to another, and communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate of what they haue by way of commerce or otherwiſe: And by this meanes is made of many Prouinces and king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes, yea, euen of the whole world, one ſole Citie and commonwealth. This was the counſell of <hi>Themiſtocles,</hi> and <hi>Plutarch</hi> makes it good, ſaying, Let no man deceiue him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, in imagining with himſelfe, that Armies will ſuffice for to conſerue himſelfe, and to make himſelfe Lord of thoſe kingdomes and Prouinces, that haue the Sea to friend. For if he be not likewiſe prouided, and well furniſhed with a ſtrong fleete at Sea, howbeit hee may with a Land-armie ouercome the naturalls of thoſe kingdomes or Prouinces; yet it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible for him, without the other, to make an intire con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt, and to go through with that which hee pretendeth. That diſpoſeth the Land to his will, and giueth Lawes there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto.
<pb n="455" facs="tcp:180809:238"/>
The <hi>Carthaginians</hi> (ſaith <hi>Polibius</hi>) were not ignorant of what great conſequence this was, for all kinde of buſineſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, and therefore aduiſeth, That that which a Prince ought to procure, whereby to come to be a great Monarch, is, by a ſtrong Nauy, to make himſelfe Lord of the Sea. For there are not any forces that worke ſuch ſtrange and great effects, or ſo much import, as theſe. And all your Ancients held it for a <hi>Maxime,</hi> that without the command at Sea, there was nothing ſafe or ſecure on the Land. <hi>Archidamus</hi> a great Captaine, and King of the <hi>Lacedemonians,</hi> was wont to ſay; That thoſe that are to deale with a ſtrong enemie, being powerfull at ſea, need not to put themſelues vpon the fickle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of fortune, but to place all their care in maintaining their Nauie; for with this alone, will they be able to wearie out the enemie, to quit him of the ſuccour of their friends, to debarre him of Nauigation, and of the commodities there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, and vtterly by this to vndoe him. And (which may ſeeme a thing impoſſible) be able to beleaguer and girt in a whole kingdome, and to take it (forcing it by famine and other wants) as if it were onely one ſingle Citie that were beſieged. For that (as <hi>Tacitus</hi> ſaith) a ſtrong fleete at ſea, is the Caſtle and Magaſine of victualls. And therefore the Empire and Signiorie of the Sea, by a powerfull and commanding Nauy, is held to bee of much more power and ſafetie, then your Land-armies or Citie-gariſons, which of force muſt in the end yeeld vnto him, which ſhall become Maſter of their ports, and thereby hinder them of all commerce and traf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fique, and humane communicat<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>And this was the aduice which that great Monarch and Emperour <hi>Charles</hi> the fifth gaue likewiſe vnto his ſonne, to whom hee left ſo many and ſuch great kingdomes, ſo farre diſtant and diuided one from another, with ſuch large and deepe ſeas. Hee (ſaith he) that is or will bee Maſter of them, muſt haue his fleetes ſtill in a readineſſe, well fitted and fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed, as well with good tall ſhips, well rigg'd and mann'd,
<pb n="456" facs="tcp:180809:239"/>
and all other neceſſary prouiſion, as with ſtore of Gallies, for the ſafeguard and defence of his ſubiects, as alſo to reſiſt and offend <hi>Turkes, Moores,</hi> and Pyrats, becauſe he cannot repoſe any confidence or aſſurance in thoſe Leagues and Truces which he ſhall make with them. With this ſhall hee keepe them all in awe, when they ſhall ſee his great forces at Sea, by which he may (as it were in an inſtant) from all parts ſend ſuccours and reliefe, and whatſoeuer elſe ſhall bee needfull: And it will bee no leſſe then a hard rayne, and cruell ſtrong curbe, for to bridle and reſtraine the ſiniſter intents and vaine pretenſions of ſuch as ſhall plot ſtrange proiects, dangerous deſignes, and ſcandalous attempts. And vtterly to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage them from vndergoing any enterpriſe, or to vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take any action of aduenture, with hope of recouering ſuch Townes or Prouinces as they haue loſt, or by landing of their men to encroach vpon new. And ſay they ſhould ſerue for no other vſe, ſaue to hinder the excurſions of Pyrats, and Sea-rouers, in theſe our ſeas, onely in regard of that, it could not chooſe but bee a matter of mighty conſequence, and of wonderfull great importance, conſidering the daily incurſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, loſſes, flaughters, the continuall captiuatings, and rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beries, which they vſually commit vpon theſe our Coaſts; ſo that if there were not a fitting preparation, and ſufficient de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of ſhips and Gallies, it were impoſſible for vs to oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curre againſt thoſe neceſſities, and to bee prouided againſt thoſe new and ſtrange accidents which may offer themſelues in thoſe Eſtates, kingdomes, and Signiories, Seas, Coaſts, frontiers, ports, promontories, Caſtles, and forts, which we hold in them. Which by this our continuall nauigation, and prouiſion of good ſhipping, are well man'd and victualled, and ſufficiently prouided of armes, munition, and whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer elſe is neceſſarie, in fit and conuenient both time and manner againſt all occaſions. Whereby the enemie percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing how well they are prouided for them, dare not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach thoſe places, nor touch vpon them. Beſides this eaſie
<pb n="457" facs="tcp:180809:239"/>
and ſhort aduice, there are many other cauſes that may moue vs not to be wanting herein. In a word, it will put the enemy into a continuall care, and driue him to take a different reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution in thoſe his ill-grounded motiues and pretenſions. And howbeit it be true, that the charge is great, ſo likewiſe great loſſes are thereby excuſed, and ſome ſuch ſometimes as can neuer bee repaired. So that, there is no paſſing to and fro without nauigation, and the vſing and maintaining of theſe fleetes.</p>
               <p>They are the words of that victorious Emperour, which no King for want of experience ſhould diſ-eſteeme.</p>
               <p>And for the better and fuller prouiſion in this kinde, it is very fit that theſe Fleetes ſhould haue their particular rent approprietated vnto them, and that it ſhould not, vpon no occaſion whatſoeuer, be ſpent or laid out in any other thing. For a ſet and deputed treaſure for this purpoſe, or the like, is that which moſt importeth for the good diſpatch of buſineſ<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſes, and that they may bee done in their due time, and with leſſe charge, and more profit. This courſe did the Grecians take; and after them, the Romanes. And of <hi>Auguſtus Caeſar,</hi> both <hi>Suetonius</hi> and <hi>Dyon</hi> report, that he was the firſt inuenter of a perpetuall militarie treaſure, raiſed out of a certaine kind of Tributes, which out of his owne curioſitie he had ſought and found out. For Souldiers and warlike prouiſions, in your great Empires, require a particular treaſure, wherewith to be payed; which muſt not in any hand be otherwiſe imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, nor go intermixed with thoſe other expences. Hauing perſons of much experience and honeſtie, appointed for the good managing and ordering of it, vſing their beſt care and helpe, that it may bee preſerued and continued, and that it may not be exhauſted, and drawne dry. And more particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly Kings themſelues, the <hi>Grandes</hi> and Peeres of the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, as alſo the commonwealths, and your Cities, ſhould carefully looke hereunto. Being that they do moſt participate of the profits which iſſue from a warre. And moſt certaine it
<pb n="458" facs="tcp:180809:240"/>
is, that nothing is more neceſſarie in a Monarchie, then this particular treaſure, or that cauſeth more reſpect in our friends, or feare in our enemies. Or that with more commoditie and conueniencie, puts in execution all plots and proiects, in this, or that other enterpriſe, of what qualitie or condition ſoeuer they bee. And to this aduice I ſhall adde that which fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth.</p>
               <p>All wiſe and prudent Princes in Empires, that are runne out to waſte, and decreaſe of wealth, haue euermore held it for the onely remedie of their reparation and conſeruation, to excuſe vnneceſſarie expences; And that their Miniſters take this buſineſſe into conſultation, and to caſt vp all ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts, and to ſee what the Kings rents and in-comes are for the defraying of the charge he is at, and by comparing one with the other, and ſeeing how they will anſwer each other, if they finde the expence to exceed the In-come, to caſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout which way it may be beſt ſpared; and to husband the buſineſſe ſo, that there may be ſome ouerplus ſtill remaining for the publike treaſurie. For if by diſorder &amp; ill gouernment, the Kings coffers ſhall come to be emptie, it will bee (if not impoſſible) at leaſt very hard to fill them againe. For if there be daily more ſpent, then is to be, or can be had, that ſtocke will in a ſhort time decay and come to nothing; as wee ſee it fareth in euery other humane ſubiect, that hath not freſh ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply. Which lauiſh and vnproportionable ſpending, not liuing according to the rate of their rents, hath been the vndoing of many particular houſes &amp; families, as alſo the impoueriſhing and ouerthrowing of Empires &amp; kingdomes. And therefore to auoide this inconuenience, was that booke of Accounts, or Memoriall made, which the Ancient called <hi>Breuiarium Imperij,</hi> a briefe abridgement of the Empire, which <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtus Caeſar</hi> left to his ſucceſſours; written with his owne hand: wherein was particularly ſet downe in a true and iuſt account, the full number of all the kingdomes and Prouinces of the whole Romane Empire; As likewiſe the number of
<pb n="459" facs="tcp:180809:240"/>
all the Citizens and Souldiers which were in euery one of them, together with their forces and ſtrength, and to what quantitie came all the rents and tributes that hee had, what aide-money and other helpes hee receiued from his Confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derates, and the whole charge he was at. As alſo his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cels ordained by him, either for the inlarging or ſhortning of his hand in theſe his expences. So that hauing ſtill before his eyes the wealth and ſubſtance of his Empire, he might al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes ſee how the world went, and how to make his beſt benefit thereof, for the conſeruing and vpholding of his Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire. Such a Regiſter or rent-roll as this, much importeth Kings. It is ſaid of that wiſe and prudent King, <hi>Don Philip</hi> the ſecond, that in his time he had ſuch another as was this; And the like ought all Kings to haue, and at all times, but more eſpecially when their power is leſſened, their rents di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſhed, their forces waſted, and thoſe of their enemies aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented. For we ſee the like care to bee taken in particular houſes, and therefore ought much more to bee looked into in Monarchies, which are compoſed of all thoſe houſes and families; amongſt which, that which ſpends beyond it's meanes, conſumes it ſelfe: For ſuppoſing ſuch <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>one hath an 100. V. Ducats of rent, or ſet reuenue, and that euery yeare ten thouſand more is ſpent, then the rent comes to, in a few yeares all will come to nothing, and by running ſtill on in debt, and taking no courſe to come out of it, by liuing ſtill at the ſame height, he muſt bee inforced in the end to ſell and deliuer ouer the luſter, maieſtie, and greatneſſe of his houſe to other families, which were before little better then duſt taken out of the dunghill. And moſt certaine it is, that they that will not caſt vp their accounts, and looke throughly into their eſtates, and ſee in what ſtate they are, muſt bee either men that are willing to vndoe themſelues, and their whole poſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie; and muſt bee either Atheiſts, or almoſt as bad (if not worſe) meere Epicures; who carry in their mouths, and in their hearts thoſe words of your vnthriſtie gallants: <hi>Comeda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus

&amp; bibamus, cras enim moriemur:</hi> Let vs eate and drinke, for to morrow we ſhall dye. Your Atheiſts, they propoſe an end vnto themſelues, thinking by this their prodigalitie to procure vnto themſelues an immortalitie of fame; But theſe and the like, who ſo inconſiderately runne out of all, are care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe and negligent euen of this, taking care onely to eate, and to drinke, and to feaſt one another, without ſo much as thinking that there is another world, or any honour, or fame in this: And ſpending their whole life in belly cheare, and bezeling, they are neuer ſatisfied, but call in ſtill for more, till their crawes be ready to cracke. And notwithſtanding the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſiue rents, which ſome Kings haue, and the great ſtore of treaſure that comes to their coffers, beſides the Tributes, Taxes, Impoſts, and Subſedies that are duely payed them, they are neuer out of debt, the Crowne-land lying impawned for the payment thereof, and that for no ſmall ſummes of money. Ordinary expences are ill husbanded; extraordinary, worſe payed. The Cities, they are conſumed; Trading de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cayed; the Subiects out of breath and purſe, and by hauing too much impoſed vpon them, are growne (like ouer-labour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed oxen) ſo poore, and ſo weake, that they are no longer able to beare ſo great a burthen. And yet all this to them (though the Subiect infinitely ſuffer) is no more then a drop of water throwne into the ſea, nor makes no more ſhew. Which ſea though it ſwallow vp all the fountaines of the earth, all the brookes, and all the great and principall riuers, and leſſer ſprings, and this daily and hourely, and at all times, yet we ſee the Sea is neuer a whit the more increaſed, nor growes greater one yeare then another. But what ſhould bee the cauſe of this, let your Naturaliſts, and your Kings, render ſuch reaſons as pleaſeth them, in their excuſe; of mine owne part, I am of opinion, that the Kings Exchequer is not well ordered, making him not onely a ſmall, but a bad account; That there is a great deale of diſorder in the laying out of thoſe monies, whereof much might bee ſaued, if there were
<pb n="461" facs="tcp:180809:241"/>
ſome orderly courſe taken for the diſpending of them, and imploying them for their Kings beſt aduantage. And I feare me, (which I could wiſh were cauſeleſſe) that a great part of this water which ſhould come directly to the Kings owne ciſterne, paſſeth through broken pipes, that is, through the hands of euill Miniſters, which ſoake and ſucke vnto them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues a great part thereof, and no man the wiſer, where the leake is, till it diſcouer it ſelfe. But it is now high time to grow to an end, and I will conclude this Aduertiſement with that common Prouerbe, which ſpeaketh thus; <hi>Quien mucho abar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca, poco aprieta:</hi> The ouer-griping hand holds but little; ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting with that of ours, All couet, all looſe.

For Kings are Companions, and fellow-ſeruants with vs in their affections, and naturall paſſions; nay (by their leaue bee it ſpoken) more ſubiect then we are vnto them; ſaue that they ſuppreſſe them more in outward ſhew, and make not that exteriour demonſtration of them, in regard of that diuinitie, which they pretend, and repreſent. And all of them will be Maſters of their entire will and abſolute power. And that Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uourite is fouly deceiued, and in a ſtrange kinde of errour, who in Court, by his ſecret plots, and cloſe conueyance, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendeth to poſſeſſe his Kings heart, if hee conceiue by this courſe to be the more ſecure. For very dangerous is that fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour and place, which is built vpon ſuch a foundation; and very tickliſh the ſtate of a Fauourite, when a King carries ſuch reſpect vnto him.

                  <hi>Vide ne fece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris, conſeruus enim tuus ſum, &amp; fratrum tuorum:</hi> See thou doe it not, for I am thy fellow ſeruant, and the fellow-ſeruant of thy brethren, &amp;c. Let euery Fauourite apply this counſell to himſelfe, and make vſe thereof; ſo ſhall he be in grace with King and people, and when men ſhall go about as it were to adore him, and to make him a little God almighty, in doing him worſhip and honour, let him by no meanes giue way thereunto, but meekly acknowledge that he is but a creature, as they are, and preuent them with that anſwer of the Angell, <hi>Vide ne feceris, conſeruus tuus ſum:</hi> Doe not offer it, for I am your fellow-ſeruant. And great is that obligation which they haue, which are raiſed to great place, to know them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, and not to ſhew themſelues ſtrangers to thoſe that haue beene their aſſociates and companions in their meaner fortunes, and with whom they haue held priuate familiarity and friendſhip. And not to be like vnto <hi>Pharaohs</hi> Cup-bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer, who when he ſaw himſelfe in that fauour and priuacie, which his fellow-priſoner <hi>Ioſeph</hi> had foretold, and progno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticated vnto him, neuer thought no more of it, but quite for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>got both it and him, as if there had beene no ſuch matter, or man. It argues extreame lightneſſe, and a naughty nature, that a man ſhould hoyſe ſaile and be gone, when he hath a faire winde, and not take him along with him, that hath runne through all perills and dangers with him, and indured all brunts and ſtormes whatſoeuer. How ſhamefull a thing then
<pb n="464" facs="tcp:180809:243"/>
is it for them, who ſeeing themſelues in proſperitie, turne away their face from him, who ranne along with them in their aduerſer fortune. Eſpecially conſidering they are not certaine, how long this calme will endure, and what a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort it is in a ſtorme, to haue a true friend to ſticke cloſe vnto him. For it is a vſuall thing, to ſee him lowermoſt to day, that yeſterday ſtood vppermoſt in Fortunes wheele. And the Moone, when it is at full, fore-tells a wane; and therefore that which importeth them moſt, is, That they carry themſelues in a gentile faſhion towards all men, and that their dealing be plaine, and diſ-intereſſed; whereby they ſhall not onely keepe their old friends, but gaine new, and may very well hope to be holpen by them, when they ſhall haue occaſion to vſe them. For they muſt thinke, that the skie will not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes bee cleare, clouds may ariſe, the Sunne withdraw his light (for Kings wills and affections, like other mens, are ambulatorie) and then in what a poore caſe is a Fauourite, if he be left, like a ſingle propoſition, alone to himſelfe: He can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not (if he be wiſe) but make this account with himſelfe, that the greateſt power ſtirreth vp the greateſt enuie; and if many combine againſt him (be he the greateſt Fauourite that euer was, or can bee ſuppoſed) they will ſhrewdly put him to his trumpes, and if they be of as noble courage and wit, as they are nobly deſcended, they will heaue him out of the ſaddle, when he thinkes he ſits ſureſt. For concealed hatred is worſe then open enmitie. And therefore let him gaine new friends, keepe his old, and not looſe any one, of thoſe he hath gotten. For being left ſingle, and alone, he ſhall bee like vnto that white Crow in the Fable, whom the crowes would not come neare, becauſe of his colour; nor the pigeons keepe him company, in regard of his greatneſſe; ſo that all will flie from him, and in the time of his greateſt need hee ſhall be left all alone. <hi>Vae ſoli:</hi> Woe bee to him that is alone. And the holy Ghoſt ſeemeth to take pittie of him that is alone, for that if he fall, he hath no body to helpe him vp.</p>
               <p>Let Fauourites likewiſe conſider, that they are not, for
<pb n="465" facs="tcp:180809:243"/>
that their King hath expreſt his affection vnto them, and profeſt himſelfe to bee their friend, to thinke, that (like a dogge in a ſlip) they may leade him whither and which way they liſt. For there are many things to be done, which hee is to doe without them. For (as <hi>Cicero</hi> ſaith) that friendſhip which admitteth not exception in ſome caſes, is not ſo much <hi>Amicitia,</hi> as <hi>Coniuratio;</hi> Amitie, as conſpiracie. It is obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued by the learned Saint <hi>Ambroſe,</hi> That true friendſhip is grounded vpon that which is iuſt and honeſt; and is ſo limit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that if it breake thoſe bounds, it doth not onely looſe it's name, but affoords iuſt cauſe for a man to forgoe his friend. Friendſhip is to be held; but alwayes with this <hi>prouiſo,</hi> that the Lawes of Iuſtice and Charitie bee duely obſerued; and when ought, contrary thereunto, is pretended, it is no lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger ſaid to bee friendſhip; though vowes and proteſtations haue paſt, for the better ſtrengthening and confirming of it. For if a King ſhall ſweare amiſſe, and contrary to the rules of charitie, he is not bound to cumply with his oath, nor is there any reaſon for it in the world, why hee ſhould in ſuch ſort make deliuery and reaſon of his heart to his Fauourite, and let him haue ſo much the hand of him, as to promiſe to ſticke vnto him, or to ſtand his friend in thoſe things that are vnlawfull and vniuſt. As thoſe Kings, <hi>Aſſuerus</hi> and <hi>Tiberius</hi> proceeded with <hi>Haman</hi> and <hi>Scianus;</hi> who, out of the fauour that they bore vnto them, gaue them leaue to reuenge them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues of their enemies, and to execute all the tyrannies and cruelties which they could deuiſe or imagine, to ſatisfie their malice. A fault which deſerued rather (and afterwards drew on) their ſpeedier and greater fall. And well doth that Fauou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite deſerue to be ruined, that ſhall preſume to pretend <hi>hazer raga</hi> (as they ſay) <hi>con ſuamo.</hi> To ſtand iuſt in the ſame ſtreake or line with his Maſter. For if God, who ſurpaſſeth in glory, and from whom it is impoſſible to take the leaſt atome there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, and is able to turne all that he hath created into duſt, will not admit of a companion in matter of adoration and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip;
<pb n="466" facs="tcp:180809:244"/>
How much more will Kings of the earth bee offended, and now ill muſt they take it, that any Subiect ſhould equall his ſhoulder, or ſhare with him in his greatneſſe, being his honour is ſo ſhortned, and his power ſo limited? For, if out of their loue to the perſon of the Fauourite, they beare with him for a while, either for to ſhew themſelues thankfull for his good ſeruices, or haply to make him the inſtrument to worke their reuenge on others; Yet theſe affections and proofes (which I ſpeake of) being once paſſed ouer, there enters preſently in the place thereof, a naturall feare and iea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſie of their authority and greatneſſe; which doth much more ſway with them, then the loue and affection which they beare to the Fauourites perſon. Enuie likewiſe ſhe comes in, and playes her part (which is a neare neighbour, and ſtill ready at hand in Princes Courts and Pallaces) as if ſhe were Attorney generall of all thoſe great places, and fomes forth her venome, ſecretly lying in waite, and watching her time to doe miſchiefe, ſtabbing ſuddenly, deaths wound being gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen before it be dream't on; and great is the hurt which this ſo neare a neighbour to the Kings elbow, doth; and out of an in-bred ſpleene) aymeth at nothing more, then the down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fall of Fauourites. Complaints and grieuances, they alſo make their appearance in Court, being the maine witneſſes that Enuie and Paſſion bring into the Court, to make good their plea. Next after theſe, comes in the reſpect (not to ſay the feare) of thoſe that are diſcontented in all ſtates; for no King will be willing, that their Subiects vpon this ground ſhould build their rebellion, and cauſe an alteration in the kingdome; and will be as loath to bee ball'd on, by grieued and diſcontented perſons, vpon iuſtly pretended complaints; nor will he be ſo vnwiſe (for feare of other claps) to fauour one, to offend many. All of them being ſhrewd blowes, for to allay, if not quell the courage of the moſt paſſionate King towards his deareſt Fauourite; and are ſuch fierce and terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble conflicts, that they toſſe his iudgement to and fro, with
<pb n="467" facs="tcp:180809:244"/>

               <p>Gouernours and ſuch as ſit at the ſterne of a Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth, wealth, and ſuch, vnto whom Kings haue deliuered vp the keyes of their heart, and hold the rudder of the Monarchie in their hands, to ſteare and ſhape their courſe, as they will themſelues, there is no queſtion to bee made of it, but that they are in great danger vpon euery ſtorme that ſhall ariſe; for looke what misfortune ſhall befall the Commonwealth, the blame ſhall be laid vpon them, and the fault imputed ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to their ill counſell, or their ignorance, or their paſſion: For ordinarily (nay I may ſay continually) the misfortunes and ill ſucceſſes of Kings, and kingdomes, I ſay the cauſe of them is attributed to thoſe that are neareſt and deareſt about the Kings perſon, and poſſeſſe the higheſt places. And euery one running along with the common opinion (and few are they which haue not a ſmacke or taſte thereof) laboureth to lay the fault on his neighbour, though he be of his owne pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per fleſh and bloud. And this is an inheritance which wee haue from our father <hi>Adam.</hi> And no man is aſhamed there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of: for we are all of vs his heires; and therefore ought to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deuour (as much as in them lies) that the peace and quiet of the kingdome bee not diſturbed or troubled in the time of their gouernment. As well for their glorie and reputation, to haue in all their proceedings carried themſelues in ſuch ſort, that no ill accident hath betided them, or any maine diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace; as alſo for the not ſubiecting of themſelues to the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certaine chances of fortune, which are ordinary vpon euery alteration, and may ſerue to worke their ruine and perdition. Let therefore thoſe haue an eye (I ſay it, and ſay it againe) that are Priuie-Councellours to their King, and more parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly the Fauourite, to whom hee ſhall haue deliuered vp the poſſeſſion of his heart, that the aduice and counſell which they ſhall giue vnto him, bee good, pure, and cleare water, iſſuing from forth a pure, cleane, and diſintereſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Such is the water (ſaith <hi>Ariſtotle</hi>) as is the earth, through which it paſſeth; if through mynes of brimſtone, it ſcaldes and burnes, if through craggy rocks, it cooles and ſtupefies; and if through ſalt-pits, it is briniſh and brackiſh. The like iudgement may wee make of counſell; if it proceed from a breaſt and heart that is ſoule and filthy, it teacheth filthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe; if from a pure, and cleane, honeſtie, and cleanneſſe; if from a liberall, it doth good vnto all; if from a couetous, it aduiſeth nothing but gripping and wringing of the Subiect. So that counſell is figured forth vnto vs in water: which in it's ſoftneſſe, ſauour, colour, and ſent, is perfectly knowne, whether the myne be good or bad, through which it paſſeth. And ſuch is their opinion, and that which they aduiſe, as is the humour that is predominant in their ſtomacke. Euerie one caſts his eye vpon his owne particular, approuing and accounting that for iuſt which tends to his profit, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demning the contrary. God deliuer Kings from ſuch Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellours, and let them take heed that they doe not erre in their aduiſe, and in thoſe medicines and remedies, which hey preſcribe vnto their Kings, for it is as it were a remedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe and irrecouerable errour; and theirs muſt bee the fault, and many times the puniſhment, but alwayes the note and infamie of their Kings erring. Nor let thoſe that haue the Kings care, make a mockerie of my words, for it is a very dangerous and tickliſh place that they poſſeſſe. Where, to erre, is an eaſie thing; but to hit right, hard; and euen then, when they leaſt thinke of it, their preciouſeſt Iewells, their richeſt Mettalls, and their greateſt treaſures are turned into coales, and the like traſh, like thoſe moneyes of your Hob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goblins, Fairies, and <hi>Robin</hi> good-fellowes. It is an old thred<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bare ſaying, That ill counſell turnes to the Councellours owne hurt. <hi>Conſilium malum, conſultori peſsimum</hi> (ſaith <hi>Plu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarch.</hi>

high, it ſhall fall vpon his owne head; And as hee, that ſmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth with guile, woundeth himſelfe; And whoſo diggeth a pit, ſhall fall therein; And he that layeth a ſtone in his neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours way, ſhall ſtumble thereon: And he that layeth a ſnare for another, ſhall be taken in it himſelfe; ſo, whoſo giueth a wicked noyſome counſell, it ſhall come vpon himſelfe, and he ſhall not know from whence. Wicked counſell is like a whirlwinde, which turnes againſt himſelfe, cauſing a very dangerous tempeſt againſt that very place from whence it came. And therefore he that giues counſell, it importeth him much, that he giue good and ſound aduice; for if it bee not good, God doth permit, that it maketh for their owne great hurt and perdition. As it ſucceeded with thoſe Princes of Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylon, who ſo ill aduiſed their King againſt iuſt <hi>Daniel;</hi> God ſo ordering the buſineſſe, that the ſame ill that they intended againſt him, fell vpon themſelues, their wiues, and their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren. When God is willing to put his armes athwart, and to croſſe wicked purpoſes, little will auaile all the ill counſell in the world, be the pate, that hatcheth it, as wiſe and as ſubtill as <hi>Achitophels.</hi> As it fared with that great Fauourite of king <hi>Aſſuerus,</hi> in that deuilliſh and malitious plot of his, which he had imagined, and contriued againſt poore honeſt <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dochee.</hi> But this was to him, <hi>elſuenno del perro</hi> (as it is in the Fable) like to the dogges dreame. There was a dogge that did dreame, that he was eating a good morſell of fleſh, and as he was chopping of it vp, vttered ſome broken notes in his lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, of the great content that he tooke therein.

are giuen contrary to good manners, light vpon their heads, that gaue them. And therefore let Councellours bee well ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſed, what counſell they giue. <hi>Aelian</hi> reporteth that there was a very ancient Law, and duely kept in the kingdome of <hi>Perſia,</hi> that if any ſhould aduiſe the King to any thing that was not beneficiall to his perſon, and the commonwealth, preſently by the common Cryer, his ill counſell was publiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and himſelfe taken and ſtript, and openly whipt vp and downe the ſtreets. And if there were ſuch a Law in force here with vs, and as duely obſerued, I aſſure my ſelfe, that neither Kings would be ſo often deceiued, as now they are; nor would there be ſo many vndertakers and proiectors, who impudently preſume to put into their heads, things that are ſo pernicious to their owne conſcience, and the publike good.</p>
               <p>Supreme authoritie, Kings neither ought to giue, nor Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uourites take it. Let them (as much as they can) conceale from the world, that great grace and fauour wherein they ſtand with their King; but if there ſhall bee an impoſſibilitie in that, yet there is none in this, to let pretenders know, that all conſiſteth in the Prince; and to referre the conferring of all benefits, fauours, and graces vnto him; and to let him haue all the thankes, in matter of penſions, offices, or rewards; and to attribute vnto him, all thoſe ſucceſſes, that fall out well and happily, and all other good and prudent reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; and to free him from the blame of thoſe that ſhall otherwiſe ſucceed. To treate him with much reuerence and reſpect; to beare him exceeding great loue; And together with theſe, to be wonderfull ſolicitous and carefull in all that ſhall concerne his ſeruice. All of them being notable and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarie qualities, for to conſerue Fauourites in their Kings grace and good opinion, and to wedge their affection vnto them. For loue muſt bee the doore, by which the grace of a Prince is to enter. For hee muſt loue, that will bee beloued. And hauing gained it by this meanes, he muſt keepe and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue
<pb n="471" facs="tcp:180809:246"/>
it, by reuerence and humilitie in his carriage, and by being faithfull and diligent in his ſeruice. All which will be loſt by doing the contrary. And not onely ought they to carry themſelues thus towards their Kings, but are alſo to eſteeme and honour all, of all eſtates, in a fitting proportion, according to euery mans qualitie and condition. Shewing himſelfe liberall, ſolicitous, peaceable, patient, louing, kinde, and courteous towards all. All of them qualities that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue a Kings fauour, and gaine the peoples good will. A Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uourite muſt be modeſt, affable, and affoord a courteous hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring vnto all men. Beſides, it is a part of Iuſtice ſo to doe, and a very neceſſarie meanes to come to the knowledge of all things, and to be the better prouided againſt whatſoeuer ſhall occurre. Whereas on the contrary, to looke to be intreated, and ſued vnto, and not eaſie to bee ſpoken withall, argues a kinde of pride and ſtatelineſſe, which all abhorre. This is the doctrine of <hi>Tacitus,</hi> citing the example of <hi>Seianus,</hi> the Emperour <hi>Tiberius</hi> his great Fauourite; who being growne into grace with him, the better to conſerue himſelfe therein, forthwith endeauoured to fauour and pleaſure all your prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall and noble perſons in their pretenſions. For in all occur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences, he conceiued, hee might expect more kindneſſe from them, then from the baſer and meaner ſort of people; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by he came to bee loued of the one, and feared of the other; and by all of them, to be ſerued and obeyed. Inſomuch that there was not any one who did not ſeeke vnto him to medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate and make interceſſion for them, with <hi>Tiberius.</hi> And how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit he was not ignorant, that hee was ſuperiour to them all, and inferiour to none, yet did he neuer grow neglectfull of his humble carriage, and reuerent reſpect to his Prince, and a due regard vnto all. Hitherto hee proceeded fairely, and went on well, and may ſerue for a patterne and example for Fauourites; but in the reſt for a <hi>prouiſo,</hi> and admonition for Kings. For after that ambition and couetouſneſſe entred into his heart, that conſuming moath, and deuouring worme of all
<pb n="472" facs="tcp:180809:247"/>
goodneſſe, he preſently procured the charge or place of <hi>Prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectus Praetorius,</hi> or Captainſhip of the Guard; and within a ſhort time grew to be ſo abſolute therein, that he became as it were Lord and Maſter of his Prince, and cruſht all that ſtood in his way, or might be of any impediment to his pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uacie. He ſought alwayes to bee with him, leſt others might creepe in betwixt him and home, and poſſeſſe his place: ſtill humbly beſeeching him, that he would imploy him in buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes of greateſt danger and trouble, and ſuch as might re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dound moſt to the benefit of the Emperours life and ſtate. A maine point, wherewith to oblige his Prince vnto him, and to make him the more acceptable in his ſight. For thoſe that are neareſt about Kings, and are in greateſt fauour with him, ought in the greateſt dangers to ſet their foot formoſt, and to be the forwardeſt aduenturers. He did ſeeke to ouercome Art, by Art, inducing <hi>Tiberius,</hi> to retire himſelfe to places of plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, that were remote and farre from Court, to the end that whileſt he was recreating himſelfe abroad, he might diſpoſe of him, as it pleaſed him. He told him, that ſolitude was the beſt and onely courſe for the reſoluing of the graue and weighty affaires of the Empire, which otherwiſe by diuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion might receiue the ſame hurt and hinderance, as they were wont to haue heretofore. And what with this, and with giuing him to vnderſtand, that he would quit him of all the ordinarie cares and troubles of Court (moſt men vſually de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiring to ſhunne trouble, and to take their eaſe and pleaſure) hee perſwaded him to go to <hi>Capri,</hi> that hee, in the meane while, might rule and gouerne all. And in the end grew to be ſo great and powerfull, and to take ſuch ſtate vpon him, that hee would not giue audience to any, reducing them to thoſe tearmes, that they ſhould ſpeake and negociate by wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, to the end that nothing might bee treated or reſolued of, without his priuie ſaying; That by reducing buſineſſes to papers and memorialls, anſwer might bee giuen vnto them with more deliberation, and better conſideration then by

word of mouth. A meere Artifice, &amp; cunning trick of his own inuention, to make himſelfe abſolute Maſter of all, and (which is more) of the heart of his Prince. God deliuer vs from ſuch ambitious, intereſſed, and couetous Miniſters, whoſe maine care, is their owne particular, and to heape vp riches for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, and his; and make it their whole ſtudy and onely end to keepe and continue themſelues in their kings grace and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour; and to deale with their Prince, as the Ante doth with the corne, which that it may not grow againe, and that hee may the better and more conueniently make profit thereof, preſently eates out the heart of it. God likewiſe free Kings, from this baſe ſubiection, and inſenſibilitie, and from men of that qualitie and condition, which deſire to rule and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand all.

                     </gap>us Praetorius,</hi> being as it were the ſecond perſon of the King; to whom, the weightieſt buſineſſes of peace and warre were remitted: and what therein he determined and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolued vpon, was receiued as an oracle that could not erre. Though now adayes, little credit is giuen to the words of great perſons and powerfull Miniſters, and not without cauſe; for that many of them ſay, and do not; promiſe much, and performe little. And your Fauourites, which haue great both place and power about their Kings, are in ſuch good opinion and credit likewiſe with the world, that they preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly beleeue whatſoeuer they ſay; and ſee what they profeſſe, is approued by them, as if it were a ſentence pronounced from the mouth of a moſt iuſt Iudge: And therefore they ought well and wiſely to conſider what they ſpeake, and not to inlarge themſelues in words, putting thoſe that are pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenders in great good hopes. Which if they ſhall not after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards take effect, will proue to bee no other then that faire and beautifull fruite, whoſe ſight pleaſeth the eye; but whoſe taſte killeth the body. In concluſion, this Fauourite, by round after round, clambred vp to all the honourableſt offices, and greateſt dignities of the kingdome. He came to bee <hi>Conſull,</hi> which charge hee adminiſtred with extraordinary integritie and vertue. All the Magiſtracies, Offices, and Gouernments which he held, were but as ſo many ſteps one to the other; which the Princes; vnder whom he ſerued, went ſtill increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing and augmenting. For he carried himſelfe ſo wiſely and diſcreetly in them, that there was not that office that hee bore, which did not make him the meritour and deſeruer of
<pb n="475" facs="tcp:180809:248"/>
another farre greater and better then it. And all did acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and confeſſe, that his merits and deſerts were farre grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter then all the offices put together which hee enioyed and adminiſtred. In thoſe whom he repreſented and recommend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to his King, to the end that his Maieſtie might conferre ſome one fauour or another vpon them, he euermore had an eye to the neceſſitie of the office, and the qualitie of the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon. Things wherein Fauourites ought to bee very carefull, when they imploy their fauour in furthering any man; as whether they be moued thereunto vpon a iuſt or ill affection, or by the ſole vertue and merit of the perſon, &amp;c. And not to thinke with themſelues, that becauſe they are in great grace and fauour with their King, that it is lawfull for them to vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late the Law of Iuſtice, which ought to bee equall to all, (which in eyes, not blinded with paſſion and co<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

Which is a Law that obligeth all, for that it is a naturall obligation, and hath all the Lawes of reaſon on it's ſide, which are more powerfull then either the will of Kings, or their Fauourites.

And theſe that are thus made vp in haſte, and ſo ſuddenly raiſed from that nothing, which they were, to that greatneſſe wherein they are, muſt

               <p>This great Fauourite had likewiſe ſo good a Head-peece, and knew ſo well how to gouerne vpon all occaſions, and all the accidents of that age, as well the good, as bad, the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate and vnfortunate ſucceſſes of thoſe times, that howbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>it many were the changes of thoſe Kings, yet was he ſtill in the ſame height of eſteeme, was ſuperiour vnto fortune, being in all thoſe alterations, her Lord and Maſter. All the Kings of the <hi>Gothes,</hi> whom hee ſerued, did him very particular fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uours. And although King <hi>Theodoricus</hi> was a very fortunate and valiant Prince, yet did a great part of his happineſſe and felicitie conſiſt in this, in hauing his Fauourite <hi>Caſsiodorus</hi> alwayes at his elbow, and in receiuing his good proiects, and ſound aduice which (when occaſion offered) were neuer wanting vnto him.<note place="margin">Sen lib. <hi>10.</hi> Epiſt. <hi>72.</hi>
                  </note> That being (according vnto <hi>Seneca</hi>) the beſt part of counſell, which comes in it's due time and ſeaſon; Whereas that comes toolate, and without any fruit, which is not ready at hand. For occaſion (whereunto wee muſt oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curre) oftentimes betakes her ſelfe to her wings, and flies out of our reach, if we be not quicke and nimble in laying hold on her foretop. So that all the while that this <hi>Caſsiodorus</hi> was in their ſeruice, their kingdome and Signorie continued in a moſt flouriſhing eſtate. So much can a man of ſuch cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage and counſell doe in a commonwealth. For with ſuch a Miniſters preſence, all things ſtand vpright, and go well and handſomely on; but in his abſence, and when he is wanting, all things go backward. For, being that all theſe things de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend next after God, on the worth and wiſedome of him that hath the managing of them; by his death or abſence, they runne a great hazard of miſcarrying, or ſuffer ſome
<pb n="477" facs="tcp:180809:249"/>
great hurt or detriment; as was to be ſeene in thoſe ſucceſſes of the Grecian Empire; which (no ſooner was that great go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernour <hi>Alexander</hi> dead, vnder whoſe protection it went increaſing, and liued in ſo much peace and ſecuritie) but it vaniſhed like ſo much froath. For of how much the more price and eſteeme peace is, by ſo much the more is it hazard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the loſſe of thoſe that maintaine and vphold it. Now this ſo excellent and worthy a Miniſter, when as nothing was wanting vnto him, ſaue the putting on of a Kings Crowne, refuſed it, became a Friar, and tooke vpon him the habite of the order of <hi>San Benito.</hi> And did ſo exerciſe himſelfe in continuall prayer and contemplation, that euen whileſt he liued here vpon earth, they held him for a Saint. And if he were ſo worthy a man in that age, ſeruing the Kings of the earth, with ſo much punctualitie and ſinceritie; it is not to be doubted, but that hee was as preciſe in his ſanctitie and holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of life, when he rendred himſelfe a ſlaue, and ſeruant to his Lord and Maſter the King of heauen. For your excellent wits, which know how to make aduantage of all things, and that nothing comes amiſſe vnto them, when they are once reſolued to ſerue God, they do truly humble themſelues, and with a ſtrong determination, tread and trample the world vnder their feet, and whatſoeuer therein is, and imbrace and take hold on Chriſt. And being thus occupied in holy exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſes, laden with yeares, hee departed out of this life, to that which was eternall, hauing inioyed ſome yeares of that quie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude and abundance of peace, wherewith he did eſſay to die well, (which being ſo dangerous, ſo difficult, and darke a paſſage, too little care is commonly had therein) hee paſſed from this ſhort ſtride betwixt life and death, to the eternitie of ſuch an eſtate, as we yet know not what it ſhall be, the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treames being (as we ſee) ſo farre diſtant.</p>
               <p>All that hath beene hitherto ſaid both in generall and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular, concerning a Monarchie, and kingdome, ſhall not be fruitleſſe, nor the time loſt, that hath beene ſpent in the wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting,
<pb n="478" facs="tcp:180809:250"/>
or ſhall be ſpent in the reading of this Treatiſe, if it be well and truly conſidered. For by the peruſall thereof, Kings and Princes may come to know a thouſand ſeuerall ſemblan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of Miniſters, and diſguiſed countenances of hypocriticall Courtiers, and the diuers diſpoſitions and humours, as well of the ambitious as the couetous; their affections, conditions, and naturall inclinations, whether they be by nature of great and vn<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>uly ſpirits, or whether they bee by fortune put into great places. For this, without doubt, changeth man from his firſt eſtate, and apparrelleth him with other particular affections; And in the true knowledge of theſe, conſiſteth the augmentation, conſeruation, and good gubernation of kingdomes, and commonwealths: as alſo the reputation, credit, opinion, and authoritie of Kings. In a word, they may out of theſe doctrines, and aduertiſements, collect and know how at one time the naturall diſpoſitions, cuſtomes, and man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners of the vulgar, ſtand affected, and how at another time thoſe that are not ſo vulgar, and of ſo low a ranke, and how at all times to make vſe of this knowledge, for the better in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſing and inlarging of their power and greatneſſe; and how, and in what manner, they are to carry themſelues to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards them; as alſo thoſe other, that are to aide and aſſiſt in gouernment. For there is not any thing of more price, or more to be valued by Kings, then this knowledge of the affections, as well for the diſcerning thoſe of others, as the moderating of their owne. And as it were to make a iudgement, and to prognoſticate by them, the end of the actions of thoſe that are about, and where they intend to make their ſtop, and ſet vp their reſt, be they foes, or friends. And by the actions of thoſe that are preſent (be they Confederates, Miniſters, and dependents) their ends, deſignes, and pretenſions. And par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly in thoſe who cleaue cloſer to their Kings fortune, then his perſon. Points, whereon doth hang the hinge, and wherein are included and ſhut vp, all both the particular and generall paſſages of gouernment, and of that art, and ſcience,
<pb n="479" facs="tcp:180809:250"/>
which they call by the common name of Reaſon of State. And although I know for certaine, that there will not ſuch be wanting, that will laugh and ſcoffe at theſe my Politicall Aduertiſements; ſome becauſe they would be accounted the onely men ſeene in this Science, and would make themſelues the onely admired men amongſt the vulgar, and that there is not any one that is a profeſſour in that Art, that vnderſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth their plots and deſignes: Others, leſſe malignant, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ignorant of the ſecrets of this Science, iudging it to be an Art, full of impoſſibilities, will not trouble themſelues there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withall, nor looke into the Myſteries thereof, as if by the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects, they were not able to iudge of the cauſes of things; and by the carriage and ſucceſſe of former buſineſſes, to diuine of the ends and deſignes of thoſe which are now on foot. And others, farre worſe then theſe, who although they come to know this truth, deny the ſame, and ſeeke many colours both for the diſgracing of it, and the Author; and for no other reaſon in the world, but becauſe they are profeſſed enemies, to whatſoeuer counſell, that is not of their owne hatching, fearing that it might quit ſomething of the glory of their ambition. And for that they will haue nothing thought to be good, but what iſſues from forth their owne braine, they blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheme (ſaith Saint <hi>Iames</hi>) and ſpeake euill of that which they know not; and not onely not admit and receiue that good which is propounded vnto them; but (as that kingly Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet ſaith) becauſe they will neither vnderſtand nor heare it, like the Adder, they ſtop their eares with the taile of their ignorance, fearing leſt they ſhould be charmed by ſome ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour wit, and better vnderſtanding. Yet notwithſtanding, fall backe, fall edge, come what will of it, I haue cumplyed with my deſire, and (which is more) with my obligation. And if it ſhall proue to be of any vſe, profit, and ſeruice, for Kings, and for the great Councellours and Miniſters of their king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes (which haue moſt need thereof) to whoſe ſeruice it goes eſpecially directed, and perhaps may be vſefull for thoſe
<pb n="480" facs="tcp:180809:251"/>
which are not in that nature. And though haply it may not bee auaileable for amendment, yet may it ſerue for a <hi>deſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganno,</hi> and diſ-deceiuing of thoſe that are in an errour. And in caſe it ſhall not take this effect, there will be no harme done by committing it to the Preſſe, though it bee afterwards bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried in the duſt, as it hath befallen other farre better things then theſe; And Time, which couers what is paſt, and diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers what is to come, will in it's time diſcouer this, and ſuch other things, as are not yet come to light. And for this cauſe, they called <hi>Archimedes</hi> the Syracuſan, The Inuenter of new Things, and the Regiſter of old. And certaine it is, that amongſt the Ancients, there was a great agreement and Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifice in the gouernment of ſome commonwealths, as was that of the <hi>Aegyptians,</hi> of the <hi>Athenians,</hi> of the <hi>Allmanes,</hi> and aboue all, of the <hi>Romane</hi> Commonwealth; Which Saint <hi>Auſten</hi> did ſo much admire. And men looking no further then to that which is before them, haue, in a manner, quite forgotten that, and therefore it is fit that there ſhould bee ſome Remembrancer, that by putting them in minde of that which is paſt, they may the better performe things for the preſent, and prouide for that which is to come. For (as <hi>Plato</hi> ſaid, though in another ſence) all our knowledge is but a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordation of things paſt; and therein he ſaid well. For a great part of thoſe nouelties, which are daily introduced, are but old things, that haue layen long in obliuion; and that which is done to day, we finde, is forgotten to morrow. And in the reuolution of time, comes (in after ages) to repreſent it ſelfe for new. And this (amongſt many others) was the maine cauſe which moued me to write this Treatiſe, and which may incourage me to go on further, though I muſt confeſſe, that my penne hath out runne my intention, finding that I haue thruſt my foot deeper into the ſtirrop, then I thought to haue done; hauing made a volumne of that, which when I firſt put p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

zeale? and more eſpecially, when it is ſo naturall and proper, as that which all, and euery one, doth or ought to beare vnto his owne King and Lord. Adding thereunto mine owne particular reſpect, in regard of my nearer reference to his Maieſties ſeruice? And no ſmall ſpurre hereunto, was my honeſt true meaning heart, and the aſſurance of a good con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, whoſe whole ſtudie and deſire in this my labour hath beene, to hit as right as I could vpon that which might be moſt conuenient, for the augmentation, conſeruation, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation, authoritie, and greatneſſe of Kings; as likewiſe, what I thought would bee moſt neceſſarie for the wellfare and good gouernment of kingdomes and particular Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealths. For this doth depend on that. Though I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue there be few that thinke thereon. For moſt (I feare me) treate onely their owne buſineſſe, making that the principall, and all the reſt accidentall. Howbeit they will not ſticke to ſay, and publiſh to the world, that they onely attend the conſeruation of their Kings and Commonwealths. Would to God that it might not be ſaid of them, which he himſelfe ſaid by the mouth of that his Prophet, and Prince of his people; They honour mee with their lip, <hi>Cor autem corum longè eſt à me:</hi> But their heart is farre from mee. God I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeech thee, of thy infinite mercy, that the hearts of Kings and their Miniſters, may not be farre off from thee; nor thou from them; but that thou wilt vouchſafe to bee euermore neare at hand vnto them, and to fauour them, and direct them in all their wayes, to thy honour and glory. Amen.</p>
